Mythical Man-Month,"Brooks, Frederick P.","Few books on software project management have been as influential and timeless as The Mythical Man-Month. With a blend of software engineering facts and thought-provoking opinions, Fred Brooks offers insight for anyone managing complex projects. These essays draw from his experience as project manager for the IBM System/360 computer family and then for OS/360, its massive software system. Now, 20 years after the initial publication of his book, Brooks has revisited his original ideas and added new thoughts and advice, both for readers already familiar with his work and for readers discovering it for the first time. The added chapters contain (1) a crisp condensation of all the propositions asserted in the original book, including Brooks' central argument in The Mythical Man-Month: that large programming projects suffer management problems different from small ones due to the division of labor; that the conceptual integrity of the product is therefore critical; and that it is difficult but possible to achieve this unity; (2) Brooks' view of these propositions a generation later; (3) a reprint of his classic 1986 paper ""No Silver Bullet""; and (4) today's thoughts on the 1986 assertion, ""There will be no silver bullet within ten years."""

Integrated Approach to Software Engineering,"Jalote, Pankaj","An introductory course in Software Engineering remains one of the hardest subjects to teach. Much of the difficulty stems from the fact that Software Engineering is a very wide field which includes a wide range of topics. Con sequently, what should be the focus of an introductory course remains a challenge with many possible viewpoints. This third edition of the book approaches the problem from the perspec tive of what skills a student should possess after the introductory course, particularly if it may be the only course on software engineering in the stu dent's program. The goal of this third edition is to impart to the student knowledge and skills that are needed to successfully execute a project of a few person-months by employing proper practices and techniques. In- dently, a vast majority of the projects executed in the industry today are of this scope—executed by a small team over a few months. Another objective of the book is to lay the foundation for the student for advanced studies in Software Engineering. Executing any software project requires skills in two key dimensions— engineering and project management. While engineering deals with issues of architecture, design, coding, testing, etc., project management deals with planning, monitoring, risk management, etc. Consequently, this book fo cuses on these two dimensions, and for key tasks in each, discusses concepts and techniques that can be applied effectively on projects."

Competitive advantage : creating and sustaining superior performance,"Porter, Michael E.","Now beyond its eleventh printing and translated into twelve languages, Michael Porter’s The Competitive Advantage of Nations has changed completely our conception of how prosperity is created and sustained in the modern global economy. Porter’s groundbreaking study of international competitiveness has shaped national policy in countries around the world. It has also transformed thinking and action in states, cities, companies, and even entire regions such as Central America. Based on research in ten leading trading nations, The Competitive Advantage of Nations offers the first theory of competitiveness based on the causes of the productivity with which companies compete. Porter shows how traditional comparative advantages such as natural resources and pools of labor have been superseded as sources of prosperity, and how broad macroeconomic accounts of competitiveness are insufficient. The book introduces Porter’s “diamond,” a whole new way to understand the competitive position of a nation (or other locations) in global competition that is now an integral part of international business thinking. Porter's concept of “clusters,” or groups of interconnected firms, suppliers, related industries, and institutions that arise in particular locations, has become a new way for companies and governments to think about economies, assess the competitive advantage of locations, and set public policy. Even before publication of the book, Porter’s theory had guided national reassessments in New Zealand and elsewhere. His ideas and personal involvement have shaped strategy in countries as diverse as the Netherlands, Portugal, Taiwan, Costa Rica, and India, and regions such as Massachusetts, California, and the Basque country. Hundreds of cluster initiatives have flourished throughout the world. In an era of intensifying global competition, this pathbreaking book on the new wealth of nations has become the standard by which all future work must be measured."
Indian Banking in Transition,"Kumar, T. Ravi","India presently faces the challenge of achieving financial inclusion, with the banking system estimated to be covering only 400 million of India's population of 1.2 billion. As per Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data, current users of the banking system are largely in urban areas. An important aspect of achieving financial inclusion is also to provide a means for cash management in a safe, effective and low-cost manner. The well-documented telecom boom in India with an estimated 900 million individual users provides a potential framework that could transform the banking system in India. This paper proposes a framework for mobile phone companies to offer payment services to start with, called ""payment banks"". New technologies can reform the banking sector apart from giving a much needed impetus for the cause of financial inclusion and will be a large step forward in spreading banking services to millions of new clients in the under-banked regions of India. The need for a ""Payment Bank"" has been discussed in the NachiketMor Committee Report of the RBI. Our paper formulates a theoretical model for achieving financial Inclusion by leveraging advantages in technology in India and enabling select Telecom operators to offer rudimentary cash management services to start with before offering a bouquet of financial services products to the vast majority of India's population who do not avail of the existing network of Banks. The paper suggests possible basic changes to enable this process apart from using existing infrastructure to enable wider dissemination of financial products. An impact analysis of these suggested changes are also discussed along with remedial measures."

This year, more than 1,400 CEOs were interviewed to find out about what is at the top of their mind, focussing on the current topics globalization and complexity with a special emphasis on emerging markets like Brazil, Russia, India and China ('BRIC'). In addition to the data compiled by PwC, the PwC survey also presents in-depth interviews with five CEOs of multinational enterprises, offering insights into their personal way of dealing with globalization and managing complexity within their organizations. The authors have structured this paper into the following three parts: Part 1 critically examines the PwC survey in various aspects and presents three types of shortcomings that have been discovered (content-related, author-related, methodology-related). Part 2 deals with the PwC survey's implications for the role of corporate human resource management ('HRM') in multinational enterprises, examining changing forces in the global economy and linking them to the HRM function. Part 3 explores the impact of globalization and complexity on current international HRM literature and analyses its consistence with the findings presented in the PwC survey."

Essential C++,"Lippman, Stanley B.","In recent years, C has become the programming language most often chosen by ""serious"" programmers; those who program for a living. C's rich set of operators and library functions allows programmers to write powerful, concise, and elegant code. Furthermore, C compilers exist for virtually every type of computer, and C programs are portable between different types of computers. Perhaps the main advantage of C over other programming languages is its versatility. On the one hand, C is a powerful general-purpose language that supports structured and modular programming languages; but at the same time, it provides access to lower-level facilities that most other languages hide from the programmer. Essential C is intended for students who have had no prior programming experience. Providing a simple and brief introduction to programming in C makes this text suitable for a first semester, freshman level course. Only the basics a students needs to understand and write useful C programs are presented and explanations using computer jargon are avoided. Examples are referred to whenever possible. The topics have been carefully chosen for their relevance to practical scientific and engineering programming. Although the text is written with the scientific and engineering students in mind, it should be suitable in other disciplines as well."

Managing Software Requirements,"Leffingwell, Dean","A classic treatise that defined the field of applied demand analysis, Consumer Demand in the United States: Prices, Income, and Consumption Behavior is now fully updated and expanded for a new generation. Consumption expenditures by households in the United States account for about 70% of Americaâ__s GDP. The primary focus in this book is on how households adjust these expenditures in response to changes in price and income. Econometric estimates of price and income elasticities are obtained for an exhaustive array of goods and services using data from surveys conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, providing a better understanding of consumer demand. Practical models for forecasting future price and income elasticities are also demonstrated. Fully revised with over a dozen new chapters and appendices, the book revisits the original Taylor-Houthakker models while examining new material as well, such as the use of quantile regression and the stationarity of consumer preference. It also explores the emerging connection between neuroscience and consumer behavior, integrating the economic literature on demand theory with psychology literature. The most comprehensive treatment of the topic to date, this volume will be an essential resource for any researcher, student or professional economist working on consumer behavior or demand theory, as well as investors and policymakers concerned with the impact of economic fluctuations."

As a consequence, ASICs and ASIC-design methods have become increasingly popular in industry for a wide range of applications. The book covers both semicustom and programmable ASIC types. After describing the fundamentals of digital logic design and the physical features of each ASIC type, the book turns to ASIC logic design - design entry, logic synthesis, simulation, and test - and then to physical design - partitioning, floorplanning, placement, and routing. You will find here, in practical well-explained detail, everything you need to know to understand the design of an ASIC, and everything you must do to begin and to complete your own design. Features Broad coverage includes, in one information-packed volume, cell-based ICs, gate arrays, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (PLDs). Examples throughout the book have been checked with a wide range of commercial tools to ensure their accuracy and utility. Separate chapters and appendixes on both Verilog and VHDL, including material from IEEE standards, serve as a complete reference for high-level, ASIC-design entry. As in other landmark VLSI books published by Addison-Wesley - from Mead and Conway to Weste and Eshraghian - the author's teaching expertise and industry experience illuminate the presentation of useful design methods.

In Theory,"Ahmad, Aijaz","After the Second World War, nationalism emerged as the principle expression of resistance to Western imperialism in a variety of regions from the Indian subcontinent to Africa, to parts of Latin America and the Pacific Rim. With the Bandung Conference and the formation of the Non-Aligned Movement, many of Europe’s former colonies banded together to form a common bloc, aligned with neither the advanced capitalist “First World” nor with the socialist “Second World.” In this historical context, the category of “Third World literature” emerged, a category that has itself spawned a whole industry of scholarly and critical studies, particularly in the metropolitan West, but increasingly in the homelands of the Third World itself. Setting himself against the growing tendency to homogenize “Third World” literature and cultures, Aijaz Ahmad has produced a spirited critique of the major theoretical statements on “colonial discourse” and “post-colonialism,” dismantling many of the commonplaces and conceits that dominate contemporary cultural criticism. With lengthy considerations of, among others, Fredric Jameson, Edward Said, and the Subaltern Studies group, In Theory also contains brilliant analyses of the concept of Indian literature, of the genealogy of the term “Third World,” and of the conditions under which so-called “colonial discourse theory” emerged in metropolitan intellectual circles. Erudite and lucid, Ahmad’s remapping of the terrain of cultural theory is certain to provoke passionate response."

Social Suffering, the first volume, deals with sources and major forms of social adversity, with an emphasis on political violence. The second, Violence and Subjectivity, contains graphic accounts of how collective experience of violence can alter individual subjectivity. This third volume explores the ways communities ""cope"" with—endure, work through, break apart under, transcend—traumatic and other more insidious forms of violence, addressing the effects of violence at the level of local worlds, interpersonal relations, and individual lives. The authors highlight the complex relationship between recognition of suffering in the public sphere and experienced suffering in people's everyday lives. Rich in local detail, the book's comparative ethnographies bring out both the recalcitrance of tragedy and the meaning of healing in attempts to remake the world.

Philosophy of Science,"Papineau, David","In Knowing the Score, philosopher David Papineau uses sports to illuminate some of modern philosophy's most perplexing questions. As Papineau demonstrates, the study of sports clarifies, challenges, and sometimes confuses crucial issues in philosophy. The tactics of road bicycle racing shed new light on questions of altruism, while sporting family dynasties reorient the nature v. nurture debate. Why do sports competitors choke? Why do fans think God will favor their team over their rivals? How can it be moral to deceive the umpire by framing a pitch? From all of these questions, and many more, philosophy has a great deal to learn. An entertaining and erudite book that ranges far and wide through the sporting world, Knowing the Score is perfect reading for armchair philosophers and Monday morning quarterbacks alike."

Writing and Difference,"Derrida, Jacques","First published in 1967, Writing and Difference, a collection of Jacques Derrida's essays written between 1959 and 1966, has become a landmark of contemporary French thought. In it we find Derrida at work on his systematic deconstruction of Western metaphysics. The book's first half, which includes the celebrated essay on Descartes and Foucault, shows the development of Derrida's method of deconstruction. In these essays, Derrida demonstrates the traditional nature of some purportedly nontraditional currents of modern thought—one of his main targets being the way in which ""structuralism"" unwittingly repeats metaphysical concepts in its use of linguistic models. The second half of the book contains some of Derrida's most compelling analyses of why and how metaphysical thinking must exclude writing from its conception of language, finally showing metaphysics to be constituted by this exclusion. These essays on Artaud, Freud, Bataille, Hegel, and Lévi-Strauss have served as introductions to Derrida's notions of writing and différence—the untranslatable formulation of a nonmetaphysical ""concept"" that does not exclude writing—for almost a generation of students of literature, philosophy, and psychoanalysis. Writing and Difference reveals the unacknowledged program that makes thought itself possible. In analyzing the contradictions inherent in this program, Derrida foes on to develop new ways of thinking, reading, and writing,—new ways based on the most complete and rigorous understanding of the old ways. Scholars and students from all disciplines will find Writing and Difference an excellent introduction to perhaps the most challenging of contemporary French thinkers—challenging because Derrida questions thought as we know it."

Nature of space and time,"Hawking, Stephen","From two of the world's great physicists—Stephen Hawking and Nobel laureate Roger Penrose—a lively debate about the nature of space and time Einstein said that the most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible. But was he right? Can the quantum theory of fields and Einstein's general theory of relativity, the two most accurate and successful theories in all of physics, be united into a single quantum theory of gravity? Can quantum and cosmos ever be combined? In The Nature of Space and Time, two of the world’s most famous physicists—Stephen Hawking (A Brief History of Time) and Roger Penrose (The Road to Reality)—debate these questions. The authors outline how their positions have further diverged on a number of key issues, including the spatial geometry of the universe, inflationary versus cyclic theories of the cosmos, and the black-hole information-loss paradox. Though much progress has been made, Hawking and Penrose stress that physicists still have further to go in their quest for a quantum theory of gravity."

At the Speed of Light,"Venkataraman, G.","From the big bang to black holes, this fast-paced illustrated tour of time and space for the astro-curious unlocks the science of the stars to reveal fascinating theories, surprising discoveries, and ongoing mysteries in modern astronomy and astrophysics. Before the big bang, time, space, and matter didn't exist. In the 14 billion years since, scientists have pointed their telescopes upward, peering outward in space and backward in time, developing and refining theories to explain the weird and wonderful phenomena they observed. Through these observations, we now understand concepts like the size of the universe (still expanding), the distance to the next-nearest star from earth (Alpha Centauri, 26 trillion miles) and what drives the formation of elements (nuclear fusion), planets and galaxies (gravity), and black holes (gravitational collapse). But are these cosmological questions definitively answered or is there more to discover? Oxford University astrophysicist and popular YouTube personality Dr. Becky Smethurst presents everything you need to know about the universe in ten accessible and engagingly illustrated lessons. In Space at the Speed of Light: The History of 14 Billion Years for People Short on Time, she guides you through fundamental questions, both answered and unanswered, posed by space scientists. Why does gravity matter? How do we know the big bang happened? What is dark matter? Do aliens exist? Why is the sky dark at night? If you have ever looked up at night and wondered how it all works, you will find answers--and many more questions--in this pocket-sized tour of the universe!"

From White Dwarfs to Black Holes,"Srinivasan, G.","From White Dwarfs to Black Holes chronicles the extraordinarily productive scientific career of Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, one of the twentieth century's most distinguished astrophysicists. Among Chandrasekhar's many discoveries were the critical mass that makes a star too massive to become a white dwarf and the mathematical theory of black holes. In 1983 he shared the Nobel Prize for Physics for these and other achievements. Over the course of more than six decades of active research Chandrasekhar investigated a dizzying array of subjects. G. Srinivasan notes in the preface to this book that ""the range of Chandra's contributions is so vast that no one person in the physics or astronomy community can undertake the task of commenting on his achievements."" Thus, in this collection, ten eminent scientists evaluate Chandrasekhar's contributions to their own fields of specialization. Donald E. Osterbrock closes the volume with a historical discussion of Chandrasekhar's interactions with graduate students during his more than quarter century at Yerkes Observatory. Contributors are James Binney, John L. Friedman, Norman R. Lebovitz, Donald E. Osterbrock, E. N. Parker, Roger Penrose, A. R. P. Rau, George B. Rybicki, E. E. Salpeter, Bernard F. Schutz, and G.

Why Toast Lands Jelly-Side Down,"Ehrlich, Robert","Physics has the reputation of being difficult to understand and remote from everyday life. Robert Ehrlich, however, has spent much of his career disproving these stereotypes. In the long-awaited sequel to Turning the World Inside Out and 175 Other Simple Physics Demonstrations, he provides a new collection of physics demonstrations and experiments that prove that physics can, in fact, be ""made simple."" Intentionally using ""low tech"" and inexpensive materials from everyday life, Why Toast Lands Jelly-Side Down makes key principles of physics surprisingly easy to understand. After laying out the basic principles of what constitutes a successful demonstration, Ehrlich provides more than 100 examples. Some of the more intriguing include: Terminal Velocity of Falling Coffee Filters; Spinning a Penny; Dropping Two Rolls of Toilet Paper; Avalanches in a Sand Pile; When to Add the Cream to Your Coffee; Deep Knee Bends on a Bathroom Scale; Recoil Force on a Bent Straw; Swinging Your Arms While Walking; Estimating the Net Force on a Moving Book; and, of course, Why Toast Lands Jelly-Side Down. The book begins with a practical introduction on how to design physics demonstrations. The benefits of designing one's own ""demos"" are numerous, but primary among them is an increased understanding of basic physics. For many people who teach the principles of physics, demonstrations seem dauntingly complex, filled with hard-to-find equipment and too many possibilities for failure. The demonstrations described in this book are exactly the opposite. Ehrlich describes them with characteristic candor: ""You can fit many of them in your pocket, bring them to your class without any set-up required, and best of all, you need not fear that your demo will more likely illustrate Murphy's laws rather than Newton's."" For anyone with even the slightest interest in physics, Why Toast Lands Jelly-Side Down is filled with learning opportunities. For everyone who is studying physics or teaching the subject at any level, from amateur scientists to professional teachers, it is an essential resource."

Metal and Flesh,"Dyens, Ollivier","A poetic exploration of the new world created by the collision of the biological body with technology and culture. For more than 3,000 years, humans have explored uncharted geographic and spiritual realms. Present-day explorers face new territories born from the coupling of living tissue and metal, strange lifeforms that are intelligent but unconscious, neither completely alive nor dead. Our bodies are now made of machines, images, and information. We are becoming cultural bodies in a world inhabited by cyborgs, clones, genetically modified animals, and innumerable species of human/information symbionts. Ollivier Dyens's Metal and Flesh is about two closely related phenomena: the technologically induced transformation of our perceptions of the world and the emergence of a cultural biology. Culture, according to Dyens, is taking control of the biosphere. Focusing on the twentieth century--which will be remembered as the century in which the living body was blurred, molded, and transformed by technology and culture--Dyens ruminates on the undeniable and irreversible human/machine entanglement that is changing the very nature of our lives."

Divided into six parts, the textbook elaborates various aspects of macro-economics—circular flow and its effects on national income, monetary theory, business cycle theory and macroeconomic policies—in detail. The book makes clear the difference between three approaches to economics—Keynesian economics, which focuses on demand; New-classical economics, which is based on rational expectations and efficient markets; and Innova-tion economics, which is focused on long run growth through innovation. A prominent feature of this text is the use of simple algebraic expressions and formulations to reinforce analytical expositions of complex macroeconomic theories in students. The book also explicates how macroeconomic models and their forecasts can be utilized by both governments and large corporations to assist in the development and evaluation of economic policy. The chapters are incorporated with real-life examples giving practical insight on the subject. Primarily intended for the undergraduate and postgraduate students of economics, this book can also be beneficial for the students opting for the courses in commerce."
Beyond Orientalism,"Dallmayr, Fred","Beyond Orientalism explores the confluence of contemporary Western (especially Continental) philosophy, with its focus on otherness and difference, and the ongoing process of globalization or the emergence of the ""global village."" The basic question raised in the book is: What will be the prevailing life-form or discourse of the global village? Will it be the discourse of Western science, industry, and metaphysics which, under the banner of modernization and development, seeks to homogenize the world in its image? In Said's work, this strategy was labeled ""Orientalism."" Or will it be possible to move ""beyond Orientalism"" in the direction neither of global uniformity nor radical fragmentation? After discussing the broad range of possible ""modes of cross-cultural encounter"" in a historical perspective, the book develops as a preferred option the notion of a deconstructive dialogue or a ""hermeneutics of difference"" which respects otherness beyond assimilation. This hermeneutics is illustrated in chapters examining several bridge-builders between cultures, primarily the Indian philosophers Radhakrishnan and J. L. Mehta and the Indologist Halbfass. The remaining chapters are devoted to more concrete social-political problems, including issues of modernization, multiculturalism, and the prospects of a globalized democracy which bids farewell to Orientalism and Eurocentrism."

Sendmail,"Costales, Bryan","If you had a list of the words used to describe sendmail, they'd probably include reliable, flexible, configurable, complex, monolithic, and daunting. But you're not likely to find the word easy. Even seasoned sendmail pros are sometimes frustrated by the intricacies of sendmail's configuration files. With a little determination and the help of a good reference book, like sendmail, Third Edition, you can master this demanding program. But when there's a significant point release, like sendmail V8.13, where do you turn?An excellent companion to our popular sendmail, Third Edition, the sendmail 8.13 Companion provides a timely way to document the improvements in V8.13 in parallel with its release. The book highlights the important changes in the latest update to sendmail, pointing out not just what is handy or nice to have, but what's critical in getting the best behavior from sendmail. This is especially important now that spam is on the rise, and because mobile technology requires roving laptops to use encrypted connections.Not surprisingly, many of the changes and additions to V8.13 have been driven by the ongoing fight against spam. Anyone concerned about spam--and who isn't?--will benefit greatly by upgrading to V8.13 sendmail. Among its many enhancements, V8.13 includes new routines that support the SPF sending site authentication standard (in the Milter library), simultaneous connection control, high connection rate control, and finer tuning of SASL parameters. The additions to the Milter library, alone, make upgrading worthwhile, but sendmail's connection control makes it a no-brainer. The key to understanding them is the sendmail 8.13 Companion.The book is divided into twenty-five chapters that parallel the chapters in the third edition of the sendmail book. For instance, if you're interested in Options configuration (Chapter 24 in sendmail), you'll turn to Chapter 24 in your companion volume to find out what's new in V8.13.For a simple dot release (8.12 to 8.13), V8.13 sendmail has added more features, options, and fundamental changes than any other single dot release has included. If you need to set up or manage sendmail, you'll want this companion volume close at hand. Even if you aren't ready to upgrade to V8.13, you'll find the key to understanding them is the sendmail 8.13 Companion a useful guide to understanding and staying current with the latest changes in sendmail."

Database nation: Death of privacy in the 21st century,"Garfinkel, Simson","Fifty years ago, in 1984, George Orwell imagined a future in which privacy was demolished by a totalitarian state that used spies, video surveillance, historical revisionism, and control over the media to maintain its power. Those who worry about personal privacy and identity--especially in this day of technologies that encroach upon these rights--still use Orwell's ""Big Brother"" language to discuss privacy issues. But the reality is that the age of a monolithic Big Brother is over. And yet the threats are perhaps even more likely to destroy the rights we've assumed were ours.Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century shows how, in these early years of the 21st century, advances in technology endanger our privacy in ways never before imagined. Direct marketers and retailers track our every purchase; surveillance cameras observe our movements; mobile phones will soon report our location to those who want to track us; government eavesdroppers listen in on private communications; misused medical records turn our bodies and our histories against us; and linked databases assemble detailed consumer profiles used to predict and influence our behavior. Privacy--the most basic of our civil rights--is in grave peril.Simson Garfinkel--journalist, entrepreneur, and international authority on computer security--has devoted his career to testing new technologies and warning about their implications. This newly revised update of the popular hardcover edition of Database Nation is his compelling account of how invasive technologies will affect our lives in the coming years. It's a timely, far-reaching, entertaining, and thought-provoking look at the serious threats to privacy facing us today. The book poses a disturbing question: how can we protect our basic rights to privacy, identity, and autonomy when technology is making invasion and control easier than ever before?Garfinkel's captivating blend of journalism, storytelling, and futurism is a call to arms. It will frighten, entertain, and ultimately convince us that we must take action now to protect our privacy and identity before it's too late."

"SSH, the Secure Shell Definitive Guide","Barrett, Danial J.","Are you serious about network security? Then check out SSH, the Secure Shell, which provides key-based authentication and transparent encryption for your network connections. It's reliable, robust, and reasonably easy to use, and both free and commercial implementations are widely available for most operating systems. While it doesn't solve every privacy and security problem, SSH eliminates several of them very effectively.Everything you want to know about SSH is in our second edition of SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide. This updated book thoroughly covers the latest SSH-2 protocol for system administrators and end users interested in using this increasingly popular TCP/IP-based solution.How does it work? Whenever data is sent to the network, SSH automatically encrypts it. When data reaches its intended recipient, SSH decrypts it. The result is ""transparent"" encryption-users can work normally, unaware that their communications are already encrypted. SSH supports secure file transfer between computers, secure remote logins, and a unique ""tunneling"" capability that adds encryption to otherwise insecure network applications. With SSH, users can freely navigate the Internet, and system administrators can secure their networks or perform remote administration.Written for a wide, technical audience, SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide covers several implementations of SSH for different operating systems and computing environments. Whether you're an individual running Linux machines at home, a corporate network administrator with thousands of users, or a PC/Mac owner who just wants a secure way to telnet or transfer files between machines, our indispensable guide has you covered. It starts with simple installation and use of SSH, and works its way to in-depth case studies on large, sensitive computer networks.No matter where or how you're shipping information, SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide will show you how to do it securely."

Baba Amte,"Staffner, Hans S. J.","Born into privilege and wealth, Murlidhar Devidas Amte was a maverick who wanted to live life to the fullest. He realized early on that he had to live, not for himself, but for others - or else all his privilege, position and superior personal qualities would be mere tinsel. The pioneering commune at Anandwan, where those affected by leprosy could live with dignity and pride; the Bharat Jodo marches across the length and breadth of India to promote national unity and harmony; the decade-long vigil by the Narmada river in solidarity with those at the receiving end of state-sponsored environmental devastation - Baba Amte did this and much more, coping the whole time with a crippling spinal degenerative disease. The countless lives transformed by three generations of the Amte family are shining testimonials to the magnitude of Baba Amte's vision, and the indomitable spirit that made that vision real. With in-depth conversations with Baba, and interviews with many of his close friends and family, this biography is equally a record of the collective memory of those who have known him best. What emerges is an intimate portrait of one of the few individuals of our times who have embodied the cherished ideals of compassion and selfless service."

In a series of works of astonishing brilliance, historian Michel Foucault excavated the hidden assumptions that govern the way we live and the way we think. The Archaeology of Knowledge begins at the level of ""things aid"" and moves quickly to illuminate the connections between knowledge, language, and action in a style at once profound and personal. A summing up of Foucault's own methadological assumptions, this book is also a first step toward a genealogy of the way we live now. Challenging, at times infuriating, it is an absolutey indispensable guide to one of the most innovative thinkers of our time."

Introduction to Expert Systems,"Jackson, Peter","In May 1997, IBM's Deeper Blue defeated the world chess champion Gary Kasparov, showing that an artificial intelligence system can outplay even the most skilled of human experts. Since the first expert systems appeared in the late sixties, we have seen three decades of research and development engineer human knowledge to more practical ends, in a pioneering effort that has integrated diverse areas of cognitive and computer science. Today, expert systems exist in many forms, from medical diagnosis to investment analysis and from counseling to production control. This third edition of Peter Jackson's best-selling book updates the technological base of expert systems research and embeds those developments in a wide variety of application areas. The earlier chapters have been refocused to take a more practical approach to the basic topics, while the later chapters introduce new topic areas such as case-based reasoning, connectionist systems and hybrid systems. Results in related areas, such as machine learning and reasoning with uncertainty, are also accorded a thorough treatment. The new edition contains many new examples and exercises, most of which are in CLIPS, a language that combines production rules with object-oriented programming. LISP, PROLOG and C++ are also featured where appropriate. Interesting problems are posed throughout, and are solved in exercises involving the analysis, design and implementation of CLIPS programs. This book will prove useful to a wide readership including general readers, students and teachers, software engineers and researchers. Its modular structure enables readers to follow a pathway most suited to their needs, providing them with an up-to-date account of expert systems technology. Peter Jackson is Director of Research at West Group, a division of The Thomson Corporation and the leading provider of information to the US legal market. Peter drives the application of natural language and information retrieval technologies to the information needs of law and business. Previous appointments include Principal Scientist at the McDonnell Douglas Research Laboratories in Saint Louis, Missouri, and Lecturer in the Department of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland."
Object-Oriented Thought Process,"Weisfeld, Matt","Object-oriented programming (OOP) is the foundation of modern programming languages, including C++, Java, C#, Visual Basic .NET, Ruby, Objective-C, and Swift. Objects also form the basis for many web technologies such as JavaScript, Python, and PHP. It is of vital importance to learn the fundamental concepts of object orientation before starting to use object-oriented development environments. OOP promotes good design practices, code portability, and reuse–but it requires a shift in thinking to be fully understood. Programmers new to OOP should resist the temptation to jump directly into a particular programming language or a modeling language, and instead first take the time to learn what author Matt Weisfeld calls “the object-oriented thought process.” Written by a developer for developers who want to improve their understanding of object-oriented technologies, The Object-Oriented Thought Process provides a solutions-oriented approach to object-oriented programming. Readers will learn to understand the proper uses of inheritance and composition, the difference between aggregation and association, and the important distinction between interfaces and implementations. While programming technologies have been changing and evolving over the years, object-oriented concepts remain a constant–no matter what the platform. This revised edition focuses on the OOP technologies that have survived the past 20 years and remain at its core, with new and expanded coverage of design patterns, avoiding dependencies, and the SOLID principles to help make software designs understandable, flexible, and maintainable."

Oracle PL/SQL Best Practices,"Feuerstein, Steven","In this book, Steven Feuerstein, widely recognized as one of the world's experts on the Oracle PL/SQL language, distills his many years of programming, writing, and teaching about PL/SQL into a set of PL/SQL language ""best practices""--rules for writing code that is readable, maintainable, and efficient. Too often, developers focus on simply writing programs that run without errors--and ignore the impact of poorly written code upon both system performance and their ability (and their colleagues' ability) to maintain that code over time.Oracle PL/SQL Best Practices is a concise, easy-to-use reference to Feuerstein's recommendations for excellent PL/SQL coding. It answers the kinds of questions PL/SQL developers most frequently ask about their code: How should I format my code? What naming conventions, if any, should I use? How can I write my packages so they can be more easily maintained? What is the most efficient way to query information from the database? How can I get all the developers on my team to handle errors the same way? The book contains 120 best practices, divided by topic area. It's full of advice on the program development process, coding style, writing SQL in PL/SQL, data structures, control structures, exception handling, program and package construction, and built-in packages. It also contains a handy, pull-out quick reference card. As a helpful supplement to the text, code examples demonstrating each of the best practices are available on the O'Reilly web site.Oracle PL/SQL Best Practices is intended as a companion to O'Reilly's larger Oracle PL/SQL books. It's a compact, readable reference that you'll turn to again and again--a book that no serious developer can afford to be without."

Significantly revised and expanded, this second edition not only covers Java 1.4, but adds new coverage of JDBC, NIO, Servlets, EJB and JavaServer Pages. Suitable for intermediate and advanced Java developers, this text also covers JDBC, RMI/CORBA, Servlets, JavaServer Pages and custom tag libraries, XML, internationalization, JavaMail, Enterprise JavaBeans and performance tuning. It should be a useful resource for teaching how to create a tuning strategy, how to use profiling tools to understand a program's behaviour, and how to avoid performance penalties from inefficient code, making them more efficient and effective. The result is code that's robust, maintainable and fast."
Java security,"Oaks, Scott","One of Java's most striking claims is that it provides a secure programming environment. Yet despite endless discussion, few people understand precisely what Java's claims mean and how it backs up those claims. If you're a developer, network administrator or anyone else who must understand or work with Java's security mechanisms, Java Security is the in-depth exploration you need. Java Security, 2nd Edition, focuses on the basic platform features of Java that provide security--the class loader, the bytecode verifier, and the security manager--and recent additions to Java that enhance this security model: digital signatures, security providers, and the access controller. The book covers the security model of Java 2, Version 1.3, which is significantly different from that of Java 1.1. It has extensive coverage of the two new important security APIs: JAAS (Java Authentication and Authorization Service) and JSSE (Java Secure Sockets Extension). Java Security, 2nd Edition, will give you a clear understanding of the architecture of Java's security model and how to use that model in both programming and administration. The book is intended primarily for programmers who want to write secure Java applications. However, it is also an excellent resource for system and network administrators who are interested in Java security, particularly those who are interested in assessing the risk of using Java and need to understand how the security model works in order to assess whether or not Java meets their security needs."

Bioinformatics: The Machine Learning Approach,"Baldi, Pierre","A guide to machine learning approaches and their application to the analysis of biological data. An unprecedented wealth of data is being generated by genome sequencing projects and other experimental efforts to determine the structure and function of biological molecules. The demands and opportunities for interpreting these data are expanding rapidly. Bioinformatics is the development and application of computer methods for management, analysis, interpretation, and prediction, as well as for the design of experiments. Machine learning approaches (e.g., neural networks, hidden Markov models, and belief networks) are ideally suited for areas where there is a lot of data but little theory, which is the situation in molecular biology. The goal in machine learning is to extract useful information from a body of data by building good probabilistic models—and to automate the process as much as possible. In this book Pierre Baldi and Søren Brunak present the key machine learning approaches and apply them to the computational problems encountered in the analysis of biological data. The book is aimed both at biologists and biochemists who need to understand new data-driven algorithms and at those with a primary background in physics, mathematics, statistics, or computer science who need to know more about applications in molecular biology. This new second edition contains expanded coverage of probabilistic graphical models and of the applications of neural networks, as well as a new chapter on microarrays and gene expression.

Perceptrons,"Minsky, Marvin","The first systematic study of parallelism in computation by two pioneers in the field. Reissue of the 1988 Expanded Edition with a new foreword by Léon Bottou In 1969, ten years after the discovery of the perceptron—which showed that a machine could be taught to perform certain tasks using examples—Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert published Perceptrons, their analysis of the computational capabilities of perceptrons for specific tasks. As Léon Bottou writes in his foreword to this edition, “Their rigorous work and brilliant technique does not make the perceptron look very good.” Perhaps as a result, research turned away from the perceptron. Then the pendulum swung back, and machine learning became the fastest-growing field in computer science. Minsky and Papert's insistence on its theoretical foundations is newly relevant. Perceptrons—the first systematic study of parallelism in computation—marked a historic turn in artificial intelligence, returning to the idea that intelligence might emerge from the activity of networks of neuron-like entities. Minsky and Papert provided mathematical analysis that showed the limitations of a class of computing machines that could be considered as models of the brain. Minsky and Papert added a new chapter in 1987 in which they discuss the state of parallel computers, and note a central theoretical challenge: reaching a deeper understanding of how “objects” or “agents” with individuality can emerge in a network. Progress in this area would link connectionism with what the authors have called “society theories of mind.”"
History of Modern Computing,"Ceruzzi, Paul E.","From the first digital computer to the dot-com crash—a story of individuals, institutions, and the forces that led to a series of dramatic transformations. This engaging history covers modern computing from the development of the first electronic digital computer through the dot-com crash. The author concentrates on five key moments of transition: the transformation of the computer in the late 1940s from a specialized scientific instrument to a commercial product; the emergence of small systems in the late 1960s; the beginning of personal computing in the 1970s; the spread of networking after 1985; and, in a chapter written for this edition, the period 1995-2001. The new material focuses on the Microsoft antitrust suit, the rise and fall of the dot-coms, and the advent of open source software, particularly Linux. Within the chronological narrative, the book traces several overlapping threads: the evolution of the computer's internal design; the effect of economic trends and the Cold War; the long-term role of IBM as a player and as a target for upstart entrepreneurs; the growth of software from a hidden element to a major character in the story of computing; and the recurring issue of the place of information and computing in a democratic society. The focus is on the United States (though Europe and Japan enter the story at crucial points), on computing per se rather than on applications such as artificial intelligence, and on systems that were sold commercially and installed in quantities."

MATLAB,Math Works Inc.,"In recent years, the life sciences have embraced simulation as an important tool in biomedical research. Engineers are also using simulation as a powerful step in the design process. In both arenas, Matlab has become the gold standard. It is easy to learn, flexible, and has a large and growing userbase. MATLAB for Engineering and the Life Sciences is a self-guided tour of the basic functionality of MATLAB along with the functions that are most commonly used in biomedical engineering and other life sciences. Although the text is written for undergraduates, graduate students and academics, those in industry may also find value in learning MATLAB through biologically inspired examples. For instructors, the book is intended to take the emphasis off of learning syntax so that the course can focus more on algorithmic thinking. Although it is not assumed that the reader has taken differential equations or a linear algebra class, there are short introductions to many of these concepts. Following a short history of computing, the MATLAB environment is introduced. Next, vectors and matrices are discussed, followed by matrix-vector operations. The core programming elements of MATLAB are introduced in three successive chapters on scripts, loops, and conditional logic. The last three chapters outline how to manage the input and output of data, create professional quality graphics and find and use Matlab toolboxes. Throughout, biomedical examples are used to illustrate MATLAB's capabilities.

Art of Cooperation,"Lavelle, Anne","In What We Made, Tom Finkelpearl examines the activist, participatory, coauthored aesthetic experiences being created in contemporary art. He suggests social cooperation as a meaningful way to think about this work and provides a framework for understanding its emergence and acceptance. In a series of fifteen conversations, artists comment on their experiences working cooperatively, joined at times by colleagues from related fields, including social policy, architecture, art history, urban planning, and new media. Issues discussed include the experiences of working in public and of working with museums and libraries, opportunities for social change, the lines between education and art, spirituality, collaborative opportunities made available by new media, and the elusive criteria for evaluating cooperative art. Finkelpearl engages the art historians Grant Kester and Claire Bishop in conversation on the challenges of writing critically about this work and the aesthetic status of the dialogical encounter. He also interviews the often overlooked co-creators of cooperative art, ""expert participants"" who have worked with artists. In his conclusion, Finkelpearl argues that pragmatism offers a useful critical platform for understanding the experiential nature of social cooperation, and he brings pragmatism to bear in a discussion of Houston's Project Row Houses.

Information Warfare and Security,"Denning, Dorothy E.","What individuals, corporations, and governments need to know about information-related attacks and defenses! Every day, we hear reports of hackers who have penetrated computer networks, vandalized Web pages, and accessed sensitive information. We hear how they have tampered with medical records, disrupted emergency 911 systems, and siphoned money from bank accounts. Could information terrorists, using nothing more than a personal computer, cause planes to crash, widespread power blackouts, or financial chaos? Such real and imaginary scenarios, and our defense against them, are the stuff of information warfare-operations that target or exploit information media to win some objective over an adversary. Dorothy E. Denning, a pioneer in computer security, provides in this book a framework for understanding and dealing with information-based threats: computer break-ins, fraud, sabotage, espionage, piracy, identity theft, invasions of privacy, and electronic warfare. She describes these attacks with astonishing, real examples, as in her analysis of information warfare operations during the Gulf War. Then, offering sound advice for security practices and policies, she explains countermeasures that are both possible and necessary. You will find in this book: A comprehensive and coherent treatment of offensive and defensive information warfare, identifying the key actors, targets, methods, technologies, outcomes, policies, and laws; A theory of information warfare that explains and integrates within a single framework operations involving diverse actors and media; An accurate picture of the threats, illuminated by actual incidents; A description of information warfare technologies and their limitations, particularly the limitations of defensive technologies. Whatever your interest or role in the emerging field of information warfare, this book will give you the background you need to make informed judgments about potential threats and our defenses against them. 0201433036B04062001"

Introduction to Neural Networks,"Anderson, James","An Introduction to Neural Networks falls into a new ecological niche for texts. Based on notes that have been class-tested for more than a decade, it is aimed at cognitive science and neuroscience students who need to understand brain function in terms of computational modeling, and at engineers who want to go beyond formal algorithms to applications and computing strategies. It is the only current text to approach networks from a broad neuroscience and cognitive science perspective, with an emphasis on the biology and psychology behind the assumptions of the models, as well as on what the models might be used for. It describes the mathematical and computational tools needed and provides an account of the author's own ideas. Students learn how to teach arithmetic to a neural network and get a short course on linear associative memory and adaptive maps. They are introduced to the author's brain-state-in-a-box (BSB) model and are provided with some of the neurobiological background necessary for a firm grasp of the general subject. The field now known as neural networks has split in recent years into two major groups, mirrored in the texts that are currently available: the engineers who are primarily interested in practical applications of the new adaptive, parallel computing technology, and the cognitive scientists and neuroscientists who are interested in scientific applications. As the gap between these two groups widens, Anderson notes that the academics have tended to drift off into irrelevant, often excessively abstract research while the engineers have lost contact with the source of ideas in the field. Neuroscience, he points out, provides a rich and valuable source of ideas about data representation and setting up the data representation is the major part of neural network programming. Both cognitive science and neuroscience give insights into how this can be done effectively: cognitive science suggests what to compute and neuroscience suggests how to compute it."

Information Technology Concepts,"Jain, Madhulika","Computing Concepts for Information Technology explains how computers really work, including how images, sounds, and video are represented by numbers and how chips with millions of transistors process those numbers. Computing Concepts for Information Technology is suitable for people with no prior study of computer systems, although it may be helpful to have experience with a high-level programming language such as Java or Python. Computing Concepts for Information Technology tells a story that begins in the 19th century and shows that the Internet, phones, tablets, and laptops that are so much a part of our lives did not spring fully formed from a Silicon Valley campus. On the inside, computers are all about numbers, and the story continues with numbers and number systems. It reveals the mysteries of binary numbers and explains why computers use a number system different from the one we use every day. One of the reviewers of the book remarked that students of computing should know enough about the digital logic that makes computers work to believe that what’s inside is not little green Martians with calculators, and the book provides a thorough explanation. Input and output, data communications, computer software, and information security are covered at a fundamental level and provide the necessary background for further study.

It has been a real pleasure using the book and my ability to program has increased beyond my wildest expectations, Thank you. Excellent!'' ''I found it clear, concise, realistically priced and is helping correct my deficient knowledge immensely.'' 20th February 2003 Reviewer: Dr. Geoff Fowler, Technical Director, Oilfield Consultancy: ''I am Technical Director of a small Oilfield Chemistry consultancy and taught myself, rather badly, Access. However all the books I bought and many online resources assume a level of knowledge hence the many mistakes I make in building databases for myself. I was browsing PC World and came across your Successful ICT Projects in Access. I found it clear, concise, realistically priced and is helping correct my deficient knowledge immensely. I will try and get your VBA book as well. Excellent! I think they are wicked!'' ''A first rate text which cannot fail to improve grades'' 3rd May, 2002 Reviewer: Miss Fozia Akram a student from Wakefield College, England: ''I would like to thank you for publishing such great books, I have purchased the A2 ICT and Access books and I think they are wicked. Thank you Payne-Gallway and thank you Pat Heathcote, lets just hope my revision pays off. A first rate text which cannot fail to improve grades''. ''The ''paint by numbers'' approach is exactly what is needed as it quickly gets results.'' 22nd September, 2001 Reviewer: Kev Randle from Sheffield, England: ''This guide to producing an ''A'' level project is going to take some beating. Some of my students have made fantastic progress in just a few hours from a starting point of zero experience with access. The ''paint by numbers'' approach is exactly what is needed as it quickly gets results. Probably feeds the ''instant gratification '' that most of our students are supposed to demand. I don''t care. As a teacher it has certainly made my life a great deal less painful and I can recommend this text to anyone taking, or teaching the AQA ICT or Computing course. It''s not even hard. Life saver!''. ''I wouldn''t have been able to do the project without it.'' 4th November, 2001 Reviewer: A Student from High Wycombe, England: ''This book pretty much lays out what is needed in the project in simple terms so that it can be adapted to your own project. Not only does it give the IT side but also the written work which is in part more important than the actual system. I wouldn''t have been able to do the project without it. Excellent book as an introduction to Access''. ''It is by far and away the most practical publication I have read on the subject'' 1st October, 2001 Reviewer: Sean Scaife from Dublin, Ireland: ''As a newcomer to Access, although over 20 years in the IT industry in various capacities, I found this work to be invaluable in being able to grasp the fundamentals of Access development. It is by far and away the most practical publication I have read on the subject, In fact I would go so far as to say that it is an object lesson to most authors of introductory works in so far that is PRACTICAL in real world sense. I have already passed on my original copy to a former colleague and have this morning recommended it to another colleague who will be purchasing it. I have no problem spending ...on other manuals but this work has helped me to produce working solutions in a very short time. Congratulations, A fan, excellent''. 17th January, 2001 Reviewer: A Reader from Leicester, England: ''This book really helps with the AS IT course when you need to do your coursework. If you are planning on using Access for your coursework, I really recommend it as it comes in very useful indeed''."

This lowers costs and brings an organization ever closer to its quality ideal."
Electromagnetic Theory and Wave Propagation,"Ghosh, S. N.","Although the fundamental concepts of Maxwell remain for the most part unchanged since their inception, electromagnetic theory has continued to evolve, extending, most significantly, to shorter and shorter wavelengths. This has revealed many of nature's mysteries. And led to a myriad of applications that have literally changed our world. The second edition of Electromagnetic Theory and Wave Propagation begins by presenting the basic concepts of electromagnetic theory, then explores the field's extended areas primarily discovered after World War II. The author elaborates on the work of pioneer investigators, particularly with respect to the identity of light and electromagnetic waves and then derives the fundamental laws of optics from electromagnetic considerations. He has also added several new topics including meteor astronomy, remote sensing and, most notably, discussions on relativistic electrodynamics."

Elementary probability theory with stochastic processes,"Chung, Kai Lai","In the past half-century the theory of probability has grown from a minor isolated theme into a broad and intensive discipline interacting with many other branches of mathematics. At the same time it is playing a centrat role in the mathematization of various applied sciences such as statistics, Opera tions research, biology, economics and psychology-to name a few to which the prefix ""mathematical"" has so far been firmly attached. The coming-of-age of probability has been reflected in the change of contents of textbooks on the subject. In the old days most of these books showed a visible split personality torn between the combinatorial games of chance and the so-called ""theory of errors"" centering in the normal distribution. This period ended with the appearance of Feller's dassie treatise (see [Feiler I]t) in 1950, from the manuscript of which I gave my first substantial course in probability. With the passage of time probability theory and its applications have won a place in the college curriculum as a mathematical discipline essential to many fields of study. The elements of the theory are now given at different Ievels, sometimes even before calculus. The present textbook is intended for a course at about the sophomore Ievel. It presupposes no prior acquaintance with the subject and the first three chapters can be read largely without the benefit of calculus."

Linear System Theory,"Callier, Frank M.","With the advancement of technology, engineers need the systems they design not only to work, but to be the absolute best possible given the requirements and available tools. In this environment, an understanding of a system's limitations acquires added importance. Without such knowledge, one might unknowingly attempt to design an impossible system. Thus, a thorough investigation of all of a system's properties is essential. In fact, many design procedures have evolved from such investigations. For use at the senior-graduate level in courses on linear systems and multivariable system design, this highly successful text is devoted to this study and the design procedures developed thereof. It is not a control text, per se--since it does not cover performance criteria, physical constraints, cost, optimization, and sensitivity problems. Chen develops major results and design procedures using simple and efficient methods. Thus, the presentation is not exhaustive; only those concepts which are essential in the development are introduced. Problem sets--following each chapter--help students understand and utilize the concepts and results covered."

Introduction to Java and Software Design,"Dale, Nell","Introduction to Java and Software Design breaks the current paradigms for teaching Java and object-oriented programming in a first-year programming course. The Dale author team has developed a unique way of teaching object-oriented programming. They foster sound object-oriented design by teaching students how to brainstorm, use filtering scenarios, CRC cards, and responsiblity algorithms. The authors also present functional design as a way of writing algorithms for the class responsibilities that are assigned in the object-oriented design. Click here for downloadable student files This book has been developed from the ground up to be a Java text, rather than a Java translation of prior works. The text uses real Java I/O classes and treats event handling as a fundamental control structure that is introduced right from the beginning. The authors carefully guide the student through the process of declaring a reference variable, instantiating an object and assigning it to the variable. Students will gradually develop a complete and comprehensive understanding of what an object is, how it works, and what constitutes a well-designed class interface."

Godan,Premchand,"""Godan,"" a cornerstone of Hindi literature, is a powerful novel by Munshi Premchand that delves deep into the socio-economic realities of rural India in the early 20th century. It tells the story of Hori, a poor peasant, and his unwavering desire to own a cow, a symbol of prosperity in the village. Hori's relentless pursuit of this dream, despite crippling debt and societal pressures, forms the central narrative of the novel. Premchand masterfully weaves together the lives of other villagers, creating a tapestry of interconnected stories that explore themes of poverty, caste discrimination, social reform, and the enduring human spirit. The novel vividly portrays the stark contrast between the wealthy landowners and the impoverished peasants, highlighting the exploitation and injustice prevalent in rural society. Hori, burdened by debt and societal obligations, struggles to make ends meet, while the wealthy landowners live in relative comfort. Premchand doesn't shy away from critiquing the rigid caste system and its dehumanizing impact on individuals. Characters like Jhunia, a young widow ostracized by society, and Gobar, Hori's son who dares to challenge traditional norms, highlight the struggle for dignity and social mobility. ""Godan"" also delves into the complexities of religion and superstition, showcasing both its positive and negative influences on the villagers. While faith provides solace and community, it can also be used to manipulate and exploit the vulnerable."
Imperial Encounters,"Veer, Peter Van Der","Picking up on Edward Said's claim that the historical experience of empire is common to both the colonizer and the colonized, Peter van der Veer takes the case of religion to examine the mutual impact of Britain's colonization of India on Indian and British culture. He shows that national culture in both India and Britain developed in relation to their shared colonial experience and that notions of religion and secularity were crucial in imagining the modern nation in both countries. In the process, van der Veer chronicles how these notions developed in the second half of the nineteenth century in relation to gender, race, language, spirituality, and science. Avoiding the pitfalls of both world systems theory and national historiography, this book problematizes oppositions between modern and traditional, secular and religious, progressive and reactionary. It shows that what often are assumed to be opposites are, in fact, profoundly entangled. In doing so, it upsets the convenient fiction that India is the land of eternal religion, existing outside of history, while Britain is the epitome of modern secularity and an agent of history. Van der Veer also accounts for the continuing role of religion in British culture and the strong part religion has played in the development of Indian civil society. This masterly work of scholarship brings into view the effects of the very close encounter between India and Britain--an intimate encounter that defined the character of both nations."

Beyond Nationalist Frames,"Sarkar,Sumit","The political context in which historians of India find themselves today, says Sumit Sarkar, is dominated by the advance of the Hindu Right and globalized forms of capitalism, while the historian's intellectual context is dominated by the marginalization of all varieties of Marxism and an academic shift to cultural studies and postmodern critique. In Beyond Nationalist Frames, one of India's foremost contemporary historians offers his view of how the craft of history should be practiced in this complex conjuncture. In studies of colonial time-keeping, Rabindranath Tagore's fiction, and pre-Independence Bengal, Sarkar explores new approaches to the writing of history. Essays on contemporary politics consider the implications of the ""Hindu Bomb,"" the rewriting of national history textbooks by Hindu fundamentalists, and the issue of conversion to Christianity.

Elements of Data Compression,"Drozdek, Adam","Today's increased use of digital sound and video makes data compression crucial to computer technology because of its vast storage and transmission requirements. The question in many applications is now not whether to compress data, but what compression method should be applied. Most data compression books have been written for professionals and require a strong background in data compression techniques as well as an understanding of algorithms based on sophisticated mathematical models. This book is one of a handful of textbooks to present Data Compression for readers in an academic environment. This is not a simple task since most of the widely used algorithms rely on sophisticated mathematical models. ELEMENTS OF DATA COMPRESSION addresses the needs of readers who will use these techniques on a daily basis. The author accomplishes this through the use of elementary-level representative methods of text, audio, and video compression. Drozdek presents these methods with pseudocode, tables, diagrams, and many worked out examples, all the while employing commonly used techniques that build upon the mathematics readers have been exposed to in earlier courses."

Computer Communication Networks,"Shanmugam, A.","In 1968 the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the U.S. Department of Defense began implementation of a computer communication network which permits the interconnection of heter ogeneous computers at geographically distributed centres through out the United States. This network has come to be known as the ARPANET and has grown from the initial four node configuration in 1969 to almost forty nodes (including satellite nodes in Hawaii, Norway, and London) in late 1973. The major goal of ARPANET is to achieve resource sharing among the network users. The resources to be shared include not only programs, but also unique facilities such as the powerful ILLIAC IV computer and large global weather data bases that are economically feasible when widely shared. The ARPANEr employs a distributed store-and-forward packet switching approach that is much better suited for computer communications networks than the more conventional circuit-switch ing approach. Reasons favouring packet switching include lower cost, higher capacity, greater reliability and minimal delay. All of these factors are discussed in these Proceedings."

802.11 Wireless Networks,"Gast, Matthew S.","As we all know by now, wireless networks offer many advantages over fixed (or wired) networks. Foremost on that list is mobility, since going wireless frees you from the tether of an Ethernet cable at a desk. But that's just the tip of the cable-free iceberg. Wireless networks are also more flexible, faster and easier for you to use, and more affordable to deploy and maintain.The de facto standard for wireless networking is the 802.11 protocol, which includes Wi-Fi (the wireless standard known as 802.11b) and its faster cousin, 802.11g. With easy-to-install 802.11 network hardware available everywhere you turn, the choice seems simple, and many people dive into wireless computing with less thought and planning than they'd give to a wired network.

Learning WML and WML Script,"Frost, Martin","The next generation of mobile communicators is here, and delivering content to them will mean programming in WML (Wireless Markup Language) and WMLScript, the languages of the Wireless Application Environment (WAE). The WAE allows information in almost all applications to be formatted for display on mobile devices, such as cell phones, and enables the user to interact with the information. Why learn yet another technology? According to some estimates, 75 percent of web document viewing by the year 2002 will be through non-desktop devices, many using wireless technologies. Clearly, the future is wireless. For web developers who want to get up to speed quickly in these languages, Learning WML & WMLScript maps out in detail the WAE and its two major components, WML and WMLScript. Fortunately, the WAE provides a World Wide Web-like model for writing applications, incorporating several key features of the Web to ease the transition for developers. Almost all wireless applications can be written with WML, which replaces HTML in the wireless environment, and WMLScript, which replaces JavaScript. With this book, web developers with some knowledge of programming and C, Java, or JavaScript syntax can easily master both languages. Chapter by chapter, Learning WML & WMLScript takes readers through the following WML topics: Decks, templates and cards User Interaction Variables and contexts Tasks, events, and timers Text and text formatting WMLScript topics include: Data types, conversions and variables Operators and expressions Statements Functions Standard libraries Learning WML & WMLScript is the resource of choice for application developers who want to upgrade their skills and their sites so they won't be left plugged in during the wireless revolution."

Designing Large-Scale LANs,"Dooley, Kevin","This unique book offers a vendor-neutral approach for designing large local area networks according to business or organizational needs, rather than from a product perspective. Author and independent network design consultant Kevin Dooley outlines ""top-down network design"" for building a technological infrastructure to fit your organization's requirements, a process far more effective and cost-efficient than fitting the organization to the parameters of a shrink-wrapped proprietary solution.Dooley argues that the design of a network is largely independent of the products used. Whether you use a Cisco or Juniper router, the same security issues and protocols apply. The questions he addresses in this book are need-specific: Do I use a router or a switch? Should I route between switched areas or switch between routed areas?Designing Large-Scale LANs covers everything from security, bandwidth and scalability to network reliability, which includes backup, redundancy, and points of failure. Specific technologies are analyzed in detail: network topologies, routing and switching strategies, wireless, virtual LANs, firewalls and gateways, security, Internet protocols, bandwidth, and multicast services. The book also discusses proprietary technologies that are ubiquitous, such as Cisco's IOS and Novell's IPX.This complete guide to top-down network design will help you choose the right network solutions. If you're designing large scale networks and need expert advice and guidance, look no further than Designing Large-Scale LANs."

Ahmedabad Chronicle,Vastu-Shilpa Foundation,"Founded in 1411 by Sultan Ahmed Shah on the banks of the river Sabarmati, Ahmedabad is today India's seventh largest city and also one of the subcontinent's few medieval cities which continues to be prosperous and important. Soon after it was established, the royal city of Ahmedabad became the commercial and cultural capital of Gujarat. When the Mughal Empire annexed Gujarat in 1572, Ahmedabad lost its political pre-eminence, but continued to flourish as a great trading centre connecting the silk route with the spice route. Briefly under the Marathas in the eighteenth century, Ahmedabad experienced a dimming of its fortunes, but with the beginning of British control from the early nineteenth century the city reasserted its mercantile ethos, even as it began questioning age-old social hierarchies. The opening of the first textile mill in 1861 was a turning point and by the end of the century Ahmedabad was known as the Manchester of the East. When Gandhi returned to India from South Africa in 1915, looking for a place where he could establish 'an institution for the whole of India', it was Ahmedabad he chose. With the setting up of his Sabarmati Ashram, the great manufacturing centre also became a centre for new awakening. It became the political hub of India, radiating the message of freedom struggle based on truth and non-violence. After Independence, it emerged as one of the fastest-growing cities of India and in the 1960s Ahmedabadis pioneered institutions of higher education and research in new fields such as space sciences, management, design and architecture. Yet, through the centuries, Ahmedabad's prosperity has been punctuated by natural disasters and social discord, from famines and earthquakes to caste and religious violence. Ahmedabadis have tried to respond to these, trying to meld economic progress with a new culture of social harmony. Coinciding with the 600th anniversary of the founding of Ahmedabad, this broad brush history highlights socio-economic patterns that emphasize Indo-Islamic and Indo-European synthesis and continuity, bringing the focus back to the pluralistic heritage of this medieval city. Evocative profiles of Ahmedabadi merchants, industrialists, poets and saints along with descriptions and illustrations of the city's art and architecture bring alive the city and its citizens."
Linear Algebra and Linear Models,"Bapat, R. B.","This book provides a rigorous introduction to the basic aspects of the theory of linear estimation and hypothesis testing, covering the necessary prerequisites in matrices, multivariate normal distribution and distributions of quadratic forms along the way.

Algebra in ancient and modern times,"Varadarajan, V. S.","From the reviews: This is a fine book on two counts. First ... there is the singularly excellent treatment of the solution of biquadratic equations. Second, it paints a strong picture of mathematics as a very long sequence of accomplishments, each building on the ones before, in a way that beginning mathematicians can understand and appreciate it. It paints the picture in a concise and economical style, the style that mathematicians find elegant. I would particularly recommend Algebra in Ancient and Modern Times to strong high school students, to high school algebra teachers, to people who want a history of mathematics with a lot of mathematics in the history, and to anyone who needs to know how to find an analytic solution to a nasty fourth degree polynomial. --MAA Online Varadarajan spins a captivating tale, and the mathematics is first-rate. The book belongs on the shelf of any teacher of algebra ... The great treasure of this book is the discussion of the work of the great Hindu mathematicians Aryabhata (c.476-550), Brahmagupta (c.598-665), and Bhaskara (c.1114-1185). Teachers of mathematics history will be especially interested in Varadarajan's exposition of the remarkable cakravala, an algorithm for solving $X^2 - NY^2= \pm 1$. The book contains many exercises that enhance and supplement the text and that also include historical information. Many of the exercises ask readers to apply the historical techniques. Some of the exercises are quite difficult and will challenge any student. --Mathematics Teacher This text offers a special account of Indian work in diophantine equations during the 6th through 12th centuries and Italian work on solutions of cubic and biquadratic equations from the 11th through 16th centuries. The volume traces the historical development of algebra and the theory of equations from ancient times to the beginning of modern algebra, outlining some modern themes such as the fundamental theorem of algebra, Clifford algebras, and quaternions. It is geared toward undergraduates who have no background in calculus. V. S. Varadarajan is a professor of mathematics at the University of California, Los Angeles."

HTML pocket reference,"Niederst, Jennifer","After years of using spacer GIFs, layers of nested tables, and other improvised solutions for building your web sites, getting used to the more stringent ""standards-compliant"" design that is de rigueur among professionals today can be intimidating. With standards-driven design, keeping style separate from content is not just a possibility but a reality.

And Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are no longer just something interesting to tinker with, but a reliable method for handling all matters of presentation, from fonts and colors to page layout. When you follow the standards, both the site's design and underlying code are much cleaner. But how do you keep all those HTML and XHTML tags and CSS values straight? Jennifer Niederst-Robbins, the author of our definitive guide on standards-compliant design, Web Design in a Nutshell, offers you the perfect little guide when you need answers immediately: HTML and XHTML Pocket Reference.

Many Ramayanas : diversity of a narrative tradition in South Asia,"Richman, Paula","Throughout Indian history, many authors and performers have produced, and many patrons have supported, diverse tellings of the story of the exiled prince Rama, who rescues his abducted wife by battling the demon king who has imprisoned her. The contributors to this volume focus on these ""many"" Ramayanas. While most scholars continue to rely on Valmiki's Sanskrit Ramayana as the authoritative version of the tale, the contributors to this volume do not. Their essays demonstrate the multivocal nature of the Ramayana by highlighting its variations according to historical period, political context, regional literary tradition, religious affiliation, intended audience, and genre. Socially marginal groups in Indian society—Telugu women, for example, or Untouchables from Madhya Pradesh—have recast the Rama story to reflect their own views of the world, while in other hands the epic has become the basis for teachings about spiritual liberation or the demand for political separatism. Historians of religion, scholars of South Asia, folklorists, cultural anthropologists—all will find here refreshing perspectives on this tale."

Programming Languages: Principles and Paradigms gives a complete, hands-on treatment of principles that uses formal grammar, type system and denotational semantics along with presenting and contrasting the major programming paradigms. The book integrates its coverage of formal semantics into its coverage of major language design topics and programming paradigms with integrated coverage of formal semantics. This integration is, in part, accomplished through the use of a small imperative language, which the authors call ""Jay."" Additionally, this book focuses on one language per paradigm (except for functional programming, where both Scheme and Haskell are used). This allows for a deeper understanding of the language paradigm, rather than a survey of all the languages that are part of it.

Voice over IP technologies : building the converged netwrok,"Miller, Mark A.","Voice over IP Technologies provides solid technical information on how to successfully design and implement a converged network, combining voice, data, fax and video transmissions into a cohesive networking infrastructure centered on the Internet Protocol. Converged networks, which combine voice, data, fax and video transmissions into a cohesive networking infrastructure -- all centered on the Internet Protocol, or IP -- promise a number of advantages over existing, separate networking environments. But to successfully design and implement a converged network requires expertise on both the voice and data networking sides of the house. Unfortunately, few individuals have these credentials -- either you are a voice networking expert, and familiar with circuit switching and connections between PBXs, or you are a data networking expert, familiar with packet switching and connections between routers and servers. The objective of this text is to bridge the gap between the voice and data networking sides, and provide the reader with the opportunity to fill in their areas of weakness with solid technical information.

Digital communication,"Lee, Edward A.","This book concerns digital communication. Specifically, we treat the transport of bit streams from one geographical location to another over various physical media, such as wire pairs, coaxial cable, optical fiber, and radio. We also treat multiple-access channels, where there are potentially multiple transmitters and receivers sharing a common medium. Ten years have elapsed since the Second Edition, and there have been remarkable advances in wireless communication, including cellular telephony and wireless local-area networks. This Third Edition expands treatment of communication theories underlying wireless, and especially advanced techniques involving multiple antennas, which tum the traditional single-input single-output channel into a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel. This is more than a trivial advance, as it stimulates many advanced techniques such as adaptive antennas and coding techniques that take advantage of space as well as time. This is reflected in the addition of two new chapters, one on the theory of MIMO channels, and the other on diversity techniques for mitigating fading. The field of error-control coding has similarly undergone tremendous changes in the past decade, brought on by the invention of turbo codes in 1993 and the subsequent rediscovery of Gallager's low-density parity-check codes. Our treatment of error-control coding has been rewritten to reflect the current state of the art. Other materials have been reorganized and reworked, and three chapters from the previous edition have been moved to the book's Web site to make room."

Modernity and self-identity : self and society in the late modern age,"Giddens, Anthony","This major study develops a new account of modernity and its relation to the self. Building upon the ideas set out in The Consequences of Modernity, Giddens argues that 'high' or 'late' modernity is a post traditional order characterised by a developed institutional reflexivity. In the current period, the globalising tendencies of modern institutions are accompanied by a transformation of day-to-day social life having profound implications for personal activities. The self becomes a 'reflexive project', sustained through a revisable narrative of self identity. The reflexive project of the self, the author seeks to show, is a form of control or mastery which parallels the overall orientation of modern institutions towards 'colonising the future'. Yet it also helps promote tendencies which place that orientation radically in question - and which provide the substance of a new political agenda for late modernity. In this book Giddens concerns himself with themes he has often been accused of unduly neglecting, including especially the psychology of self and self-identity. The volumes are a decisive step in the development of his thinking, and will be essential reading for students and professionals in the areas of social and political theory, sociology, human geography and social psychology."

Differential Equations and Their Applications,"Braun, Martin","There are two major changes in the Fourth Edition of Differential Equations and Their Applications. The first concerns the computer programs in this text. In keeping with recent trends in computer science, we have replaced all the APL programs with Pascal and C programs. The Pascal programs appear in the text in place of the APL programs, where they are followed by the Fortran programs, while the C programs appear in Appendix C. Mathematics is playing an ever more important role in the physical and biological sciences, provoking a blurring of boundaries between scientific disciplines and a resurgence of interest in the modern as well as the classical techniques of applied mathematics. This renewal of interest, both in research and teaching, has led to the establishment of the series: Texts in Applied Mathematics (TAM). The development of new courses is a natural consequence of a high Ievel of excitement on the research frontieras newer techniques, such as numerical and symbolic computer systems, dynamical systems, and chaos, mix with and reinforce the traditional methods of applied mathematics. Thus, the purpose of this textbook series is to meet the current and future needs of these advances and encourage the teaching of new courses. TAM will publish textbooks suitable for use in advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate courses, and will complement the Applied Mathematical Sciences (AMS) series, which will focus on advanced textbooks and research Ievel monographs."
Introduction to Fuzzy Control,"Driankov, Dimiter","Fuzzy controllers are a class of knowledge based controllers using artificial intelligence techniques with origins in fuzzy logic to compute an appropriate control action. These fuzzy knowledge based controllers can be found either as stand-alone control elements or as integral parts of distributed control systems including conventional controllers in a wide range of industrial process control systems and consumer products. Applications of fuzzy controllers have become a well established practice for Japanese manufacturers of control equipment and systems, and are becoming more and more common for their European and American counterparts. The main aim of this book is to show that fuzzy control is not totally ad hoc, that there exist formal techniques for the analysis of a fuzzy controller, and that fuzzy control can be implemented even when no expert knowledge is available. Thus the book is mainly oriented toward control engineers and theorists rather than fuzzy and non-fuzzy AI people. However, parts can be read without any knowledge of control theory and may be of interest to AI people. The book has six chapters. Chapter 1 introduces two major classes of knowledge based systems for closedloop control. Chapter 2 introduces relevant parts of fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic. Chapter 3 introduces the principal design parameters of a fuzzy knowledge based controller (FKBC) and discusses their relevance with respect to its performance. Chapter 4 considers an FKBC as a particular type of nonlinear controller. Chapter 5 considers tuning and adaptation of FKBCs, which are nonlinear and so can be designed to cope with a certain amount of nonlinearity. Chapter 6 considers several approaches for stability analysis of FKBCs in the context of classical nonlinear dynamic systems theory."

"QED and the men who made it : Dyson, Feynman, Schwinger and Tomonaga","Schweber, Silvan S.","In the 1930s, physics was in a crisis. There appeared to be no way to reconcile the new theory of quantum mechanics with Einstein's theory of relativity. Several approaches had been tried and had failed. In the post-World War II period, four eminent physicists rose to the challenge and developed a calculable version of quantum electrodynamics (QED), probably the most successful theory in physics. This formulation of QED was pioneered by Freeman Dyson, Richard Feynman, Julian Schwinger, and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, three of whom won the Nobel Prize for their work. In this book, physicist and historian Silvan Schweber tells the story of these four physicists, blending discussions of their scientific work with fascinating biographical sketches. Setting the achievements of these four men in context, Schweber begins with an account of the early work done by physicists such as Dirac and Jordan, and describes the gathering of eminent theorists at Shelter Island in 1947, the meeting that heralded the new era of QED. The rest of his narrative comprises individual biographies of the four physicists, discussions of their major contributions, and the story of the scientific community in which they worked. Throughout, Schweber draws on his technical expertise to offer a lively and lucid explanation of how this theory was finally established as the appropriate way to describe the atomic and subatomic realms."

Habitations of modernity : essays in the wake of subaltern studies,"Chakrabarty, Dipesh","In Habitations of Modernity, Dipesh Chakrabarty explores the complexities of modernism in India and seeks principles of humaneness grounded in everyday life that may elude grand political theories. The questions that motivate Chakrabarty are shared by all postcolonial historians and anthropologists: How do we think about the legacy of the European Enlightenment in lands far from Europe in geography or history? How can we envision ways of being modern that speak to what is shared around the world, as well as to cultural diversity? How do we resist the tendency to justify the violence accompanying triumphalist moments of modernity? Chakrabarty pursues these issues in a series of closely linked essays, ranging from a history of the influential Indian series Subaltern Studies to examinations of specific cultural practices in modern India, such as the use of khadi—Gandhian style of dress—by male politicians and the politics of civic consciousness in public spaces. He concludes with considerations of the ethical dilemmas that arise when one writes on behalf of social justice projects."
Modern Indian plays Vol.1,"Kambar, Chandrasekhar",Not Found
Modern Indian plays Vol.2,"Kambar, Chandrasekhar","Three plays that seamlessly blend the ageless with the contemporary. Chandrasekhar Kambar, recognized as one of the most progressive and influential playwrights in modern Indian theatre, masterfully transforms traditional religious and folk motifs to deliver a strikingly contemporary message. This volume brings together three of Kambar's seminal plays from the previous century. In Jokumaraswami, a phallic fertility god worshipped in Karnataka is identified with Basanna, a fearless peasant who defies a tyrannical feudal lord with tragic consequences, embodying the myth of the god in his own heroic journey. Samba Shiva is a lively, rambunctious farce filled with bawdy humor and hilarious situations. Everything is turned on its head: men become women, gods step down from their pedestals out of boredom, kings turn into donkeys, and donkeys into ministers. This acerbic comedy savagely satirizes bureaucracies, hierarchies, and the establishment at large. In Siri Sampige, an ominous prophecy looms over a brave, handsome young prince, the sole heir to the kingdom of Shivapura. An oracle warns that as the prince steps into manhood, he will either become a wandering ascetic or die due to ""one who is heir to what he is heir to."" The queen mother attempts to thwart this fate by arranging his marriage to the beautiful princess Siri Sampige, but destiny's coils tighten, and the prince is ensnared in his foretold fate."
Between tradition and modernity : India's search for identity,"Dallmayr, Fred","An AltaMira Press Book The process of modernization poses a profound challenge to societies. Nowhere is this more true than in India where cultural memories have been severely tested by colonial domination but have been loyally preserved nonetheless. This anthology documents the intellectual struggle of Indian writers and philosophers in the twentieth century to articulate the meaning of ""India"" and thereby establish an identity which bridges indigenous tradition and Western-style modernity. The book focuses on the existential dimension of India's encounter with the West-its role as a catalyst in the process of self-scrutiny and in the search for self-rule and cultural identity. As a whole, the anthology constitutes not so much an objective travellogue but rather a 'sentimental journey' reflecting the experiences of prominent Indians, thereby revealing that the process of modernization and development is really a struggle over the heart and soul of India and, by extension, over the sense and direction of humanity or humankind. It provides a timely perspective on self-understanding or self-interpretation in India's fiftieth year of independence."

Feynman's lost lecture : the motion of planets around the sun,"Goodstein, David L.","""Glorious.""—Wall Street Journal Rescued from obscurity, Feynman's Lost Lecture is a blessing for all Feynman followers. Most know Richard Feynman for the hilarious anecdotes and exploits in his best-selling books ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"" and ""What Do You Care What Other People Think?"" But not always obvious in those stories was his brilliance as a pure scientist—one of the century's greatest physicists. With this book and CD, we hear the voice of the great Feynman in all his ingenuity, insight, and acumen for argument. This breathtaking lecture—""The Motion of the Planets Around the Sun""—uses nothing more advanced than high-school geometry to explain why the planets orbit the sun elliptically rather than in perfect circles, and conclusively demonstrates the astonishing fact that has mystified and intrigued thinkers since Newton: Nature obeys mathematics. David and Judith Goodstein give us a beautifully written short memoir of life with Feynman, provide meticulous commentary on the lecture itself, and relate the exciting story of their effort to chase down one of Feynman's most original and scintillating lectures."
Quantum philosophy : understanding and interpreting contemporary science,"Omnes, Roland","In this magisterial work, Roland Omnes takes us from the academies of ancient Greece to the laboratories of modern science as he seeks to do no less than rebuild the foundations of the philosophy of knowledge. One of the world's leading quantum physicists, Omnes reviews the history and recent development of mathematics, logic, and the physical sciences to show that current work in quantum theory offers new answers to questions that have puzzled philosophers for centuries: Is the world ultimately intelligible? Are all events caused? Do objects have definitive locations? Omnes addresses these profound questions with vigorous arguments and clear, colorful writing, aiming not just to advance scholarship but to enlighten readers with no background in science or philosophy. The book opens with an insightful and sweeping account of the main developments in science and the philosophy of knowledge from the pre-Socratic era to the nineteenth century. Omnes then traces the emergence in modern thought of a fracture between our intuitive, commonsense views of the world and the abstract and--for most people--incomprehensible world portrayed by advanced physics, math, and logic. He argues that the fracture appeared because the insights of Einstein and Bohr, the logical advances of Frege, Russell, and Godel, and the necessary mathematics of infinity of Cantor and Hilbert cannot be fully expressed by words or images only. Quantum mechanics played an important role in this development, as it seemed to undermine intuitive notions of intelligibility, locality, and causality. However, Omnes argues that common sense and quantum mechanics are not as incompatible as many have thought. In fact, he makes theprovocative argument that the ""consistent-histories"" approach to quantum mechanics, developed over the past fifteen years, places common sense (slightly reappraised and circumscribed) on a firm scientific and philosophical footing for the first time. In doing so, it provides what philosophers have sought through the ages: a sure foundation for human knowledge. ""Quantum Philosophy"" is a profound work of contemporary science and philosophy and an eloquent history of the long struggle to understand the nature of the world and of knowledge itself."
McLuhan for beginners,"Gordon, W. Terrence","Marshall McLuhan was one of the most brilliant and original thinkers of the 20th century. He was so far ahead of his time that he predicted the future and offered a critique of human behavior in a media saturated world that is perhaps more valuable in today’s Internet age than it was in his own time. McLuhan pioneered the study of Media, unified Art and Science, and warned us about the perils of a televised, computerized, famous-for-15-minutes, social media world. A world where we would live in each other’s faces, and become so alike, so isolated, so anonymous that violence would become a scream of identity, a way of saying, “I am not invisible.” McLuhan tried to teach us to guard against these dehumanizing, debasing effects of technology, and a thousand other things, but we got reality television anyway. The centennial celebration of McLuhan’s life and the re-release of his books has led to a surge of new interest in his thinking and teachings. McLuhan For Beginners provides an essential introduction that is clear, comprehensive, and easy to remember. It is full of wise and witty art by Susan Willmarth that is a perfect match to W. Terrence Gordon’s writing. McLuhan envisioned the media generated Global Village before it existed, and no one since McLuhan has described its allure and pitfalls better."
Quantum generation : a history of physics in the twentinth century,"Kragh, Helge","At the end of the nineteenth century, some physicists believed that the basic principles underlying their subject were already known, and that physics in the future would only consist of filling in the details. They could hardly have been more wrong. The past century has seen the rise of quantum mechanics, relativity, cosmology, particle physics, and solid-state physics, among other fields. These subjects have fundamentally changed our understanding of space, time, and matter. They have also transformed daily life, inspiring a technological revolution that has included the development of radio, television, lasers, nuclear power, and computers. In Quantum Generations, Helge Kragh, one of the world's leading historians of physics, presents a sweeping account of these extraordinary achievements of the past one hundred years. The first comprehensive one-volume history of twentieth-century physics, the book takes us from the discovery of X rays in the mid-1890s to superstring theory in the 1990s. Unlike most previous histories of physics, written either from a scientific perspective or from a social and institutional perspective, Quantum Generations combines both approaches. Kragh writes about pure science with the expertise of a trained physicist, while keeping the content accessible to nonspecialists and paying careful attention to practical uses of science, ranging from compact disks to bombs. As a historian, Kragh skillfully outlines the social and economic contexts that have shaped the field in the twentieth century. He writes, for example, about the impact of the two world wars, the fate of physics under Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin, the role of military research, the emerging leadership of the United States, and the backlash against science that began in the 1960s. He also shows how the revolutionary discoveries of scientists ranging from Einstein, Planck, and Bohr to Stephen Hawking have been built on the great traditions of earlier centuries. Combining a mastery of detail with a sure sense of the broad contours of historical change, Kragh has written a fitting tribute to the scientists who have played such a decisive role in the making of the modern world."

Security engineering : a guide to building dependable distributed systems,"Anderson, Ross J.","Now that there's software in everything, how can you make anything secure? Understand how to engineer dependable systems with this newly updated classic In Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems, Third Edition Cambridge University professor Ross Anderson updates his classic textbook and teaches readers how to design, implement, and test systems to withstand both error and attack. This book became a best-seller in 2001 and helped establish the discipline of security engineering. By the second edition in 2008, underground dark markets had let the bad guys specialize and scale up; attacks were increasingly on users rather than on technology. The book repeated its success by showing how security engineers can focus on usability. Now the third edition brings it up to date for 2020. As people now go online from phones more than laptops, most servers are in the cloud, online advertising drives the Internet and social networks have taken over much human interaction, many patterns of crime and abuse are the same, but the methods have evolved. Ross Anderson explores what security engineering means in 2020, including: How the basic elements of cryptography, protocols, and access control translate to the new world of phones, cloud services, social media and the Internet of Things Who the attackers are – from nation states and business competitors through criminal gangs to stalkers and playground bullies What they do – from phishing and carding through SIM swapping and software exploits to DDoS and fake news Security psychology, from privacy through ease-of-use to deception The economics of security and dependability – why companies build vulnerable systems and governments look the other way How dozens of industries went online – well or badly How to manage security and safety engineering in a world of agile development – from reliability engineering to DevSecOps The third edition of Security Engineering ends with a grand challenge: sustainable security. As we build ever more software and connectivity into safety-critical durable goods like cars and medical devices, how do we design systems we can maintain and defend for decades? Or will everything in the world need monthly software upgrades, and become unsafe once they stop?"

Sartre for beginners,"Palmer, Donald","Sartre For Beginners is an accessible yet sophisticated introduction to the life and works of the famous French philosopher, Jean Paul Sartre. Sartre was a member of the French underground during WWII, a novelist, a playwright, and a major influence in French political and intellectual life. The book opens with a biographical section, introducing the significant events in the life of the man who coined the term “existentialism.” Then it examines Sartre’s early philosophical works. Ideas from Sartre’s other fictional and dramatic works are discussed, but the greatest part is the presentation of the main concepts from Sartre’s Being and Nothingness (1943). These include the topics of consciousness, freedom, responsibility, absurdity, “bad faith,” authenticity, and the hellish confrontation with other people. Finally, the book deals with Sartre’s modification of his early existentialism to compliment his conversion to a kind of “existential” Marxism. Sartre For Beginners summarizes the work of the most renown philosopher of the 20th Century."
Stanislavski : for beginners,"Allen, David","Stanislavski was the first person to develop a cogent and practical system of acting. Throughout his life he sought the answers to such fundamental questions as: ""What is great acting?"" and ""How can you find inspiration in every performance?"" Stanislavski remains the most important influence on actor training today, and yet many of his ideas are little known, or even misunderstood. Stanislavski For Beginners charts the development of the Stanislavski system. It includes a clear exposition of the key elements of the system and explores his Method of Physical Actions, which he worked on in the years before his death, and which he called “the result of my whole life’s work.”"
Cambridge Companion to Hobbes,"Sorell, Tom","This Companion makes a new departure in Hobbes scholarship, addressing a philosopher whose impact was as great on Continental European theories of state and legal systems as it was at home. This volume is a systematic attempt to incorporate work from both the Anglophone and Continental traditions, bringing together newly commissioned work by scholars from ten different countries in a topic-by-topic sequence of essays that follows the structure of Leviathan, re-examining the relationship among Hobbes's physics, metaphysics, politics, psychology, and religion. Collectively they showcase important revisionist scholarship that re-examines both the context for Leviathan and its reception, demonstrating the degree to which Hobbes was indebted to the long tradition of European humanist thought. This Cambridge Companion shows that Hobbes's legacy was never lost and that he belongs to a tradition of reflection on political theory and governance that is still alive, both in Europe and in the diaspora."
Levi-Strauss,"Leach, Edmund","In this lucide guide to the often abstruse works of Claude Lévi-Strauss, Edmund Leach synthesizes the thought of one of the twentieth century's greatest anthropologists and provides a thoughtful introduction to the theory and practice of structuralism.

Thousand years of nonlinear history,"DeLanda, Manue","Following in the wake of his groundbreaking work War in the Age of Intelligent Machines, Manuel De Landa presents a brilliant, radical synthesis of historical development of the last thousand years. A Thousand Years of Nonlinear History sketches the outlines of a renewed materialist philosophy of history in the tradition of Fernand Braudel, Gilles Deleuze, and Félix Guattari, while engaging — in an entirely unprecedented manner — the critical new understanding of material processes derived from the sciences of dynamics. Working against prevailing attitudes that see history merely as the arena of texts, discourses, ideologies, and metaphors, De Landa traces the concrete movements and interplays of matter and energy through human populations in the last millennium. The result is an entirely novel approach to the study of human societies and their always mobile, semi-stable forms, cities, economies, technologies, and languages. De Landa attacks three domains that have given shape to human societies: economics, biology, and linguistics. In each case, De Landa discloses the self-directed processes of matter and energy interacting with the whim and will of human history itself to form a panoramic vision of the West free of rigid teleology and naive notions of progress and, even more important, free of any deterministic source for its urban, institutional, and technological forms. The source of all concrete forms in the West’s history, rather, is shown to derive from internal morphogenetic capabilities that lie within the flow of matter—energy itself. A Swerve Edition."

Understanding linux kernal,"Bovet, Daniel P.","To thoroughly understand what makes Linux tick and why it's so efficient, you need to delve deep into the heart of the operating system--into the Linux kernel itself. The kernel is Linux--in the case of the Linux operating system, it's the only bit of software to which the term ""Linux"" applies. The kernel handles all the requests or completed I/O operations and determines which programs will share its processing time, and in what order. Responsible for the sophisticated memory management of the whole system, the Linux kernel is the force behind the legendary Linux efficiency. The new edition of Understanding the Linux Kernel takes you on a guided tour through the most significant data structures, many algorithms, and programming tricks used in the kernel. Probing beyond the superficial features, the authors offer valuable insights to people who want to know how things really work inside their machine. Relevant segments of code are dissected and discussed line by line. The book covers more than just the functioning of the code, it explains the theoretical underpinnings for why Linux does things the way it does. The new edition of the book has been updated to cover version 2.4 of the kernel, which is quite different from version 2.2: the virtual memory system is entirely new, support for multiprocessor systems is improved, and whole new classes of hardware devices have been added. The authors explore each new feature in detail. Other topics in the book include: Memory management including file buffering, process swapping, and Direct memory Access (DMA) The Virtual Filesystem and the Second Extended Filesystem Process creation and scheduling Signals, interrupts, and the essential interfaces to device drivers Timing Synchronization in the kernel Interprocess Communication (IPC) Program execution Understanding the Linux Kernel, Second Edition will acquaint you with all the inner workings of Linux, but is more than just an academic exercise. You'll learn what conditions bring out Linux's best performance, and you'll see how it meets the challenge of providing good system response during process scheduling, file access, and memory management in a wide variety of environments. If knowledge is power, then this book will help you make the most of your Linux system."

Cradle to Cradle: Remarking the way we make things,"McDonough, William","'Reduce, reuse, recycle' urge environmentalists; in other words, do more with less in order to minimize damage. But as architect William McDonough and chemist Michael Braungart point out in this provocative, visionary book, this approach only perpetuates the one-way, 'cradle to grave' manufacturing model, dating to the Industrial Revolution, that creates such fantastic amounts of waste and pollution in the first place. Why not challenge the belief that human industry must damage the natural world? In fact, why not take nature itself as our model for making things? A tree produces thousands of blossoms in order to create another tree, yet we consider its abundance not wasteful but safe, beautiful and highly effective. Waste equals food. Guided by this principle, McDonough and Braungart explain how products can be designed from the outset so that, after their useful lives, they will provide nourishment for something new - continually circulating as pure and viable materials within a 'cradle to cradle' model. Drawing on their experience in redesigning everything from carpeting to corporate campuses, McDonough and Braungart make an exciting and viable case for putting eco-effectiveness into practice, and show how anyone involved in making anything can begin to do so as well."

"People of India: Gujarat Vol.XXII, Part-1","Singh, K. S.","The Anthropological Survey of India launched the People of India project on 2d October 1985 to generate an anthropological profile of all communities of India, the impact on them of change and the development process, and the links that bring them together. As part of this all India project, the ethnographic survey of all the 115 communities in Assam was taken up for the first time in collaboration with local scholars. The results of this survey were discussed at the workshops held in Shillong/ Guwahati in May 1988. The space now known as Assam emerged as a distinct econo-cultural region early in history. It was peopled by the legendary kirata, whose descendants still identify themselves with the Mahabharata tradition, and with tantricism and shaktism. It has been a melting pot of ethnic streams, the most important being the Mongoloid and the Caucasoid, the Australoids constitute the substratum of most Assam population. Medieval Assam saw the rise of Assamese as language, neo-vashnavism propounded by Mahapurush Shankar Dev and the rise of a powerful state established by the Ahoms in the Brahmaputra Valley. Assam is linguistically heterogeneous with 45 languages/ dialects being spoken by the speakers of the Tibeto-Burman language family and of the Indo-Aryan language families. Ecology determines the settlement pattern and house types, the distribution of peasants and fisherfolk. Assam s identity is defined by language, territory, dress, cuisine, festivals such as Bihu, connected with fertility. The other features are availability of land and abundance of water, immigration of people, vegetarianism with fish, fish and all pervading fishing culture, settled cultivation, visibility of women in all roles, vibrant folk tradition, flourishing crafts, near absence of untouchability and rigidity of jati and varna structure, and a greater social intercourse among the communities. Assam has taken steps to grant autonomy to tribal communities. Maintenance of the integrity of Assam is integral to the peace and stability in the region."

With themes including romance, troubled royalty, treachery, banishment, desertion and punishment, the book compares these – and the complex characters – with some of Shakespeare’s most intriguing plays. These deeply thoughtful comparisons – a first of their kind – are insightfully written. Drawing from the rich tapestry of Hindu mythology, the book not only narrates Nalan and his wife Damayanthi’s progress through life, but also serves as a window into the cultural and spiritual ethos of ancient India. The story of ‘Nala Charitham’ is a captivating one, with Shakespearean comparisons giving the story a new punch and perspective."

Surdas,"Nilsson, Usha S.","No Hindu god is closer to the soul of poetry than Krishna, and in North India no poet ever sang of Krishna more famously than SūrdD=as-or Sūr, for short. He lived in the sixteenth century and became so influential that for centuries afterward aspiring Krishna poets signed their compositions orally with his name. This book takes us back to the source, offering a selection of Sūrd=as's poems that were known and sung in the sixteenth century itself. Here we have poems of war, poems to the great rivers, poems of wit and rage, poems where the poet spills out his disappointments. Most of all, though, we have the memory of love-poems that adopt the voices of the women of Krishna's natal Braj country and evoke the power of being pulled into his irresistible orbit. Following the lead of several old manuscripts, Jack Hawley arranges these poems in such a way that they tell us Krishna's life story from birth to full maturity. These lyrics from Sūr's Ocean (the Sūrs=agar) were composed in the very tongue Hindus believe Krishna himself must have spoken: Brajbh=as=a, the language of Braj, a variety of Hindi. Hawley prepares the way for his verse translations with an introduction that explains what we know of Sūrd=as and describes the basic structure of his poems. For readers new to Krishna's world or to the subtleties of a poet like Sūrd=as, Hawley also provides a substantial set of analytical notes. ""Sūr is the sun,"" as a familiar saying has it, and we feel the warmth of his light in these pages."

Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and schizophrenia,"Deleuze, Gilles","‘A major philosophical work by perhaps the most brilliant philosophical mind at work in France today.' Fredric Jameson Gilles Deleuze (1925-1995) was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Paris VIII. He was a key figure in poststructuralism, and one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century. Félix Guattari (1930-1992) was a psychoanalyst at the la Borde Clinic, as well as being a major social theorist and radical activist. Anti-Oedipus is part of Deleuze and Guattari's landmark philosophical project, Capitalism and Schizophrenia - a project that still sets the terms of contemporary philosophical debate. Anti-Oedipus is a radical philosophical analysis of desire that shows how we can combat the compulsion to dominate ourselves and others.

Molecular modeling and simulation: An interdisciplinary guide,"Schlick, Tamar","Science is a way of looking, reverencing. And the purpose of all science, like living, which amounts to the same thing, is not the ac cumulation of gnostic power, the fixing of formulas for the name of God, the stockpiling of brutal efficiency, accomplishing the sadistic myth of progress. The purpose of science is to revive and cultivate a perpetual state of wonder. For nothing deserves wonder so much as our capacity to experience it. Roald Hoffman and Shira Leibowitz Schmidt, in Old Wine, New Flasks: Re. flections on Science and Jewish Tradition (W. H. Freeman, 1997). Challenges in Teaching Molecular Modeling This textbook evolved from a graduate course termed Molecular Modeling intro duced in the fall of 1996 at New York University. The primary goal of the course is to stimulate excitement for molecular modeling research - much in the spirit of Hoffman and Leibowitz Schmidt above - while providing grounding in the discipline. Such knowledge is valuable for research dealing with many practical problems in both the acadernic and industrial sectors, from developing treatments for AIDS (via inhibitors to the protease enzyme of the human imrnunodeficiency virus, HIV-1) to designing potatoes that yie1d spot-free potato chips (via trans genic potatoes with altered carbohydrate metabolism). In the course of writing xii Preface this text, the notes have expanded to function also as an introduction to the field for scientists in other disciplines by providing a global perspective into problems and approaches, rather than a comprehensive survey."
Beta testing for better software,"Fine, Michael","Implement, operate, and use beta testing immediately with this hands-on guide to the best practices Beta testing is a complex process that, when properly run, provides a wealth of diverse information.

Yet, there is little clarity on who these people of India really are, what they do, their desires, histories and attachments to India. Similarly, the phrase 'New India' is used far too loosely to explain away a dangerously confounding politics. In this book, some of the most respected scholars of South Asia come together to write about a person or a concept that holds particular sway in the politics of contemporary India. In doing so, they collectively open up an original understanding of what the politics at the heart of New India are-and how best we might come to analyse them.

Rich with indelible wordplay, learning, and heart, Pruiksma’s translation transforms the barrier of language into a bridge, bringing the fullness of Tiruvalluvar’s poetic intensity to a new generation."

Bounds offered perhaps a more profound understanding of prayer than any other contemporary Christian thinker. His classic books on the personal communication with God explore how prayer must come from the whole being and strengthens faith in Christian lives. It is through prayer that we share our thoughts and desires our father God. Doing good works, communion, church activities and the like, do not and should not replace prayer. Prayer must be a priority in our lives. ""Prayer should be the breath of our breathing, the thought of our thinking, the soul of our feeling, and the life of our living, the sound of our hearing, the growth of our growing. Prayer in its magnitude is length without end, width without bounds, height without top, and depth without bottom. Illimitable in its breadth, exhaustless in height, fathomless in depths and infinite in extension."" In The Possibilities of Prayer E. M. Bounds addresses; The Ministry of Prayer, Prayer and the Promises, Its Possibilities, Answered Prayer, Divine Providence and much more. Edward McKendree Bounds was a clergyman of the Methodist Episcopal Church South and author of eleven books, nine of which focused on the subject of prayer. Bounds was a practicing lawyer at age nineteen and after three years, began preaching for the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. At the time of his pastorate in Brunswick, Missouri, war was declared.

Creativity : flow and the psychology of discovery and invention,"Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly","“Although the benefits of this study to scholars are obvious, this thought-provoking mixture of scholarly and colloquial will enlighten inquisitive general readers, too.” — Library Journal (starred review) The classic study of the creative process from the bestselling author of Flow. Creativity is about capturing those moments that make life worth living. Legendary psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (“The leading researcher into ‘flow states.’” — Newsweek) reveals what leads to these moments—be it the excitement of the artist at the easel or the scientist in the lab—so that this knowledge can be used to enrich people's lives. Drawing on nearly one hundred interviews with exceptional people, from biologists and physicists, to politicians and business leaders, to poets and artists, as well as his thirty years of research on the subject, Csikszentmihalyi uses his famous flow theory to explore the creative process. He discusses such ideas as why creative individuals are often seen as selfish and arrogant, and why the ""tortured genius"" is largely a myth. Most important, he explains why creativity needs to be cultivated and is necessary for the future of our country, if not the world."

Analog signal processing,"Pallas-Areny, Ramon","A proven, cost-effective approach to solving analog signal processing design problems Most design problems involving analog circuits require a great deal of creativity to solve. But, as the authors of this groundbreaking guide demonstrate, finding solutions to most analog signal processing problems does not have to be that difficult. Analog Signal Processing presents an original, five-step, design-oriented approach to solving analog signal processing problems using standard ICs as building blocks. Unlike most authors who prescribe a ""bottom-up"" approach, Professors Pallás-Areny and Webster cast design problems first in functional terms and then develop possible solutions using available ICs, focusing on circuit performance rather than internal structure. The five steps of their approach move from signal classification, definition of desired functions, and description of analog domain conversions to error classification and error analysis. Featuring 90 worked examples-many of them drawn from actual implementations-and more than 130 skill-building chapter-end problems, Analog Signal Processing is both a valuable working resource for practicing design engineers and a textbook for advanced courses in electronic instrumentation design."

Decision making under uncertainty,"Bell, David E","An introduction to decision making under uncertainty from a computational perspective, covering both theory and applications ranging from speech recognition to airborne collision avoidance. Many important problems involve decision making under uncertainty—that is, choosing actions based on often imperfect observations, with unknown outcomes. Designers of automated decision support systems must take into account the various sources of uncertainty while balancing the multiple objectives of the system. This book provides an introduction to the challenges of decision making under uncertainty from a computational perspective. It presents both the theory behind decision making models and algorithms and a collection of example applications that range from speech recognition to aircraft collision avoidance. Focusing on two methods for designing decision agents, planning and reinforcement learning, the book covers probabilistic models, introducing Bayesian networks as a graphical model that captures probabilistic relationships between variables; utility theory as a framework for understanding optimal decision making under uncertainty; Markov decision processes as a method for modeling sequential problems; model uncertainty; state uncertainty; and cooperative decision making involving multiple interacting agents. A series of applications shows how the theoretical concepts can be applied to systems for attribute-based person search, speech applications, collision avoidance, and unmanned aircraft persistent surveillance. Decision Making Under Uncertainty unifies research from different communities using consistent notation, and is accessible to students and researchers across engineering disciplines who have some prior exposure to probability theory and calculus. It can be used as a text for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in fields including computer science, aerospace and electrical engineering, and management science. It will also be a valuable professional reference for researchers in a variety of disciplines."

Bioinformatics : managing scientific data,"Lacroix, Zoe","Today, scientific data is inevitably digitized, stored in a wide variety of heterogeneous formats, and is accessible over the Internet. Scientists need to access an integrated view of multiple remote or local heterogeneous data sources. They then integrate the results of complex queries and apply further analysis and visualization to support the task of scientific discovery. Building such a digital library for scientific discovery requires accessing and manipulating data extracted from flat files or databases, documents retrieved from the Web, as well as data that is locally materialized in warehouses or is generated by software. We consider several tasks to provide optimized and seamless integration of biomolecular data. Challenges to be addressed include capturing and representing source capabilities; developing a methodology to acquire and represent semantic knowledge and metadata about source contents, overlap in source contents, and access costs; and decision support to select sources and capabilities using cost based and semantic knowledge, and generating low cost query evaluation plans."

Essentials of programming languages,"Wand, Mitchell","A new edition of a textbook that provides students with a deep, working understanding of the essential concepts of programming languages, completely revised, with significant new material. This book provides students with a deep, working understanding of the essential concepts of programming languages. Most of these essentials relate to the semantics, or meaning, of program elements, and the text uses interpreters (short programs that directly analyze an abstract representation of the program text) to express the semantics of many essential language elements in a way that is both clear and executable. The approach is both analytical and hands-on. The book provides views of programming languages using widely varying levels of abstraction, maintaining a clear connection between the high-level and low-level views. Exercises are a vital part of the text and are scattered throughout; the text explains the key concepts, and the exercises explore alternative designs and other issues. The complete Scheme code for all the interpreters and analyzers in the book can be found online through The MIT Press web site. For this new edition, each chapter has been revised and many new exercises have been added. Significant additions have been made to the text, including completely new chapters on modules and continuation-passing style. Essentials of Programming Languages can be used for both graduate and undergraduate courses, and for continuing education courses for programmers."

Introduction to coding theory and algebraic geometry,"Lint, Jacobus H. Van","It is gratifying that this textbook is still sufficiently popular to warrant a third edition. I have used the opportunity to improve and enlarge the book. When the second edition was prepared, only two pages on algebraic geometry codes were added. These have now been removed and replaced by a relatively long chapter on this subject. Although it is still only an introduction, the chapter requires more mathematical background of the reader than the remainder of this book. One of the very interesting recent developments concerns binary codes defined by using codes over the alphabet 7l.4• There is so much interest in this area that a chapter on the essentials was added. Knowledge of this chapter will allow the reader to study recent literature on 7l. -codes. 4 Furthermore, some material has been added that appeared in my Springer Lec ture Notes 201, but was not included in earlier editions of this book, e. g. Generalized Reed-Solomon Codes and Generalized Reed-Muller Codes. In Chapter 2,a section on ""Coding Gain"" ( the engineer's justification for using error-correcting codes) was added. For the author, preparing this third edition was a most welcome return to mathematics after seven years of administration. For valuable discussions on the new material, I thank C.P.l.M.Baggen, I. M.Duursma, H.D.L.Hollmann, H. C. A. van Tilborg, and R. M. Wilson. A special word of thanks to R. A. Pellikaan for his assistance with Chapter 10."

Organic chemistry,"McMurry, John","The 12th edition of Organic Chemistry continues Solomons, Fryhle & Snyder's tradition of excellence in teaching and preparing students for success in the organic classroom and beyond. A central theme of the authors' approach to organic chemistry is to emphasize the relationship between structure and reactivity. To accomplish this, the content is organized in a way that combines the most useful features of a functional group approach with one largely based on reaction mechanisms. The authors' philosophy is to emphasize mechanisms and their common aspects as often as possible, and at the same time, use the unifying features of functional groups as the basis for most chapters. The structural aspects of the authors' approach show students what organic chemistry is. Mechanistic aspects of their approach show students how it works. And wherever an opportunity arises, the authors' show students what it does in living systems and the physical world around us."

Applied combinatorics,"Tucker, Ala","The new 6th edition of Applied Combinatorics builds on the previous editions with more in depth analysis of computer systems in order to help develop proficiency in basic discrete math problem solving. As one of the most widely used book in combinatorial problems, this edition explains how to reason and model combinatorically while stressing the systematic analysis of different possibilities, exploration of the logical structure of a problem, and ingenuity. Although important uses of combinatorics in computer science, operations research, and finite probability are mentioned, these applications are often used solely for motivation. Numerical examples involving the same concepts use more interesting settings such as poker probabilities or logical games. This book is designed for use by students with a wide range of ability and maturity (sophomores through beginning graduate students). The stronger the students, the harder the exercises that can be assigned. The book can be used for one-quarter, two-quarter, or one-semester course depending on how much material is used."

Security+,"Calvert, Ben","In the chaotic heart of Eddenport Spaceport, two out-of-work ninja sisters-Reina and Kira-take the most unexpected job of their lives: security guards. Not just any security guards, though. Undercover ones, blending in with the crowd in a rotating circus of disguises: geishas, tourists, space nuns, even sandwich vendors. Their goal? Spot trouble before it knows it's trouble and drop it like a hot rock before anyone starts screaming. Armed with sarcasm, impeccable reflexes, and the kind of sisterly bond forged through years of sparring and shared laundry disasters, the duo bring crime to its knees-sometimes literally. Along the way, they make friends, outsmart crooks, dismantle smuggling rings, stop riots, and even host tea parties with warrior-poets who quote Confucius and Dr. Seuss. But spaceport life isn't all tranquil koi ponds and bad disguises. Mysterious ships, bureaucratic nonsense, and shady power players lurk around every gate. When a strange anomaly appears on the scanners, Reina and Kira must level up their game-and train the next generation of decoy defenders-to keep Eddenport from plunging into chaos. Hilarious, fast-paced, and unexpectedly heartwarming, Security is a martial arts comedy of sisterhood, misdirection, and absolute mayhem... in all the best ways."

"Simians, cyborgs and women : the reinvention of nature","Haraway, Donna J.","Simians, Cyborgs and Women is a powerful collection of ten essays written between 1978 and 1989. Although on the surface, simians, cyborgs and women may seem an odd threesome, Haraway describes their profound link as ""creatures"" which have had a great destabilizing place in Western evolutionary technology and biology. Throughout this book, Haraway analyzes accounts, narratives, and stories of the creation of nature, living organisms, and cyborgs. At once a social reality and a science fiction, the cyborg--a hybrid of organism and machine--represents transgressed boundaries and intense fusions of the nature/culture split. By providing an escape from rigid dualisms, the cyborg exists in a post-gender world, and as such holds immense possibilities for modern feminists. Haraway's recent book, Primate Visions, has been called ""outstanding,"" ""original,"" and ""brilliant,"" by leading scholars in the field. (First published in 1991.)"

Aerodynamics for engineers,"Bertin, John J.","""The study of aerodynamics is a challenging and rewarding discipline within aeronautics since the ability of an airplane to perform (how high, how fast, and how far an airplane will fly, such as the F-15E shown in Fig. 1.1 ) is determined largely by the aerodynamics of the vehicle. However, determining the aerodynamics of a vehicle (finding the lift and drag) is one of the most difficult things you will ever do in engineering, requiring complex theories, experiments in wind tunnels, and simulations using modern highspeed computers. Doing any of these things is a challenge, but a challenge well worth the effort for those wanting to better understand aircraft flight""--"

Quantum electrodynamics,"Reinhardt, Joachim","We are pleased by the positive resonance of our book which now necessitates a fourth edition. We have used this opportunity to implement corrections of misprints and amendments at several places, and to extend and improve the discussion of many of the exercises and examples. We hope that our presentation of the method of equivalent photons (Example 3. 17), the form factor of the electron (Example 5. 7), the infrared catastrophe (Example 5. 8) and the energy shift of atomic levels (Example 5. 9)arenow even better to understand. The new Exercise 5. 10 shows in detail how to arrive at the non-relativistic limit for the calculation of form factors. Moreover, we have brought up-to-date the Biographical Notes about physicists who have contributed to the dev- opment of quantum electrodynamics, and references to experimental tests of the t- ory. For example, there has been recent progress in the determination of the electric and magnetic form factors of the proton (discussed in Exercise 3. 5 on the Rosenbluth formula) and the Lamb shift of high-Z atoms (discussed in Example 5. 9 on the energy shift of atomic levels), while the experimental veri cation of the birefringence of the QED vacuum in a strong magnetic eld (Example 7. 8) remains unsettled and is a topic of active ongoing research."
Quantum mechanics : fundamentals,"Gottfried, Kurt","Quantum mechanics was already an old and solidly established subject when the first edition of this book appeared in 1966. The context in which a graduate text on quantum mechanics is studied today has changed a good deal, however. In 1966, most entering physics graduate students had a quite limited exposure to quan tum mechanics in the form of wave mechanics. Today the standard undergraduate curriculum contains a large dose of elementary quantum mechanics, and often intro duces the abstract formalism due to Dirac. Back then, the study of the foundations by theorists and experimenters was close to dormant, and very few courses spent any time whatever on this topic. At that very time, however, John Bell's famous theorem broke the ice, and there has been a great flowering ever since, especially in the laboratory thanks to the development of quantum optics, and more recently because of the interest in quantum computing. And back then, the Feynman path integral was seen by most as a veryimaginative but rather useless formulation of quantum mechanics, whereas it now plays a large role in statistical physics and quantum field theory, especially in computational work. For these and other reasons, this book is not just a revision of the 1966 edition. It has been rewritten throughout, is differently organized, and goes into greater depth on many topics that were in the old edition."

Civility of indifference : on domesticating ethnicity,"Bailey, F. G.","The dissolution of Yugoslavia inspired F. G. Bailey to consider the relations among ethnic groups that had seemed reconciled to living together and then broke into murderous conflicts. For his exploration of the ancient, recurring problem of ethnic strife, Bailey considers the village of Bisipara in the state of Orissa, in eastern India. Bisipara was a community in which different ethnic groups were seen as distinct breeds of people, arranged in a hierarchy of worthiness. In The Civility of Indifference, Bailey documents a case of ethnic strife that threatened the village forty years ago but did not consume it in bloodshed. The restraint, he suggests, reflected not compassion but a sense of inevitability. The people of Bisipara perceived the world in such a way that violence enacted as ethnic cleansing would have seemed to them a disastrous indulgence and a sure path to self-destruction. Their story serves as a parable of pragmatic indifference, in contrast to the fanaticism that justifies civil war. A seasoned ethnographer, the author considers the social structure of the community, examining the multiple castes with sensitivity and respect. His detailed description reveals the competing moral visions held by various groups and his conclusions open a new perspective on ethnic violence."

Frames of mind : the theory of multiple intelligences,"Gardner, Howard E.",Not Found
Intelligence reframed : multiple intelligences for the 21st century,"Gardner, Howard E.","Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner has been acclaimed as the most influential educational theorist since John Dewey. His ideas about intelligence and creativity - explicated in such bestselling books as Frames of Mind and Multiple Intelligences (over 200,000 copies in print combined) - have revolutionized our thinking. In his groundbreaking 1983 book Frames of Mind , Howard Gardner first introduced the theory of multiple intelligences, which posits that intelligence is more than a single property of the human mind. That theory has become widely accepted as one of the seminal ideas of the twentieth century and continues to attract attention all over the world. Now in Intelligence Reframed , Gardner provides a much-needed report on the theory, its evolution and revisions. He offers practical guidance on the educational uses of the theory and responds to the critiques leveled against him. He also introduces two new intelligences (existential intelligence and naturalist intelligence) and argues that the concept of intelligence should be broadened, but not so absurdly that it includes every human virtue and value. Ultimately, argues Gardner, possessing a basic set of seven or eight intelligences is not only a unique trademark of the human species, but also perhaps even a working definition of the species. Gardner also offers provocative ideas about creativity, leadership, and moral excellence, and speculates about the relationship between multiple intelligences and the world of work in the future."

Bobby Fischer goes to war : how the Soviets lost the most extraordinary chess match of all time,"Edmonds, David","In the summer of 1972, with a presidential crisis stirring in the United States and the cold war at a pivotal point, two men -- the Soviet world chess champion Boris Spassky and his American challenger Bobby Fischer -- met in the most notorious chess match of all time. Their showdown in Reykjavik, Iceland, held the world spellbound for two months with reports of psychological warfare, ultimatums, political intrigue, cliffhangers, and farce to rival a Marx Brothers film. Thirty years later, David Edmonds and John Eidinow, authors of the national bestseller Wittgenstein's Poker, have set out to reexamine the story we recollect as the quintessential cold war clash between a lone American star and the Soviet chess machine -- a machine that had delivered the world title to the Kremlin for decades. Drawing upon unpublished Soviet and U.S. records, the authors reconstruct the full and incredible saga, one far more poignant and layered than hitherto believed. Against the backdrop of superpower politics, the authors recount the careers and personalities of Boris Spassky, the product of Stalin's imperium, and Bobby Fischer, a child of post-World War II America, an era of economic boom at home and communist containment abroad. The two men had nothing in common but their gift for chess, and the disparity of their outlook and values conditioned the struggle over the board. Then there was the match itself, which produced both creative masterpieces and some of the most improbable gaffes in chess history. And finally, there was the dramatic and protracted off-the-board battle -- in corridors and foyers, in back rooms and hotel suites, in Moscow offices and in the White House. The authors chronicle how Fischer, a manipulative, dysfunctional genius, risked all to seize control of the contest as the organizers maneuvered frantically to save it -- under the eyes of the world's press. They can now tell the inside story of Moscow's response, and the bitter tensions within the Soviet camp as the anxious and frustrated apparatchiks strove to prop up Boris Spassky, the most un-Soviet of their champions -- fun-loving, sensitive, and a free spirit. Edmonds and Eidinow follow this careering, behind-the-scenes confrontation to its climax: a clash that displayed the cultural differences between the dynamic, media-savvy representatives of the West and the baffled, impotent Soviets. Try as they might, even the KGB couldn't help. A mesmerizing narrative of brilliance and triumph, hubris and despair, Bobby Fischer Goes to War is a biting deconstruction of the Bobby Fischer myth, a nuanced study on the art of brinkmanship, and a revelatory cold war tragicomedy."

J2EE design patterns,"Kaolan, Jonathan","Architects of buildings and architects of software have more in common than most people think. Both professions require attention to detail, and both practitioners will see their work collapse around them if they make too many mistakes. It's impossible to imagine a world in which buildings get built without blueprints, but it's still common for software applications to be designed and built without blueprints, or in this case, design patterns.A software design pattern can be identified as ""a recurring solution to a recurring problem."" Using design patterns for software development makes sense in the same way that architectural design patterns make sense--if it works well in one place, why not use it in another? But developers have had enough of books that simply catalog design patterns without extending into new areas, and books that are so theoretical that you can't actually do anything better after reading them than you could before you started.Crawford and Kaplan's J2EE Design Patterns approaches the subject in a unique, highly practical and pragmatic way. Rather than simply present another catalog of design patterns, the authors broaden the scope by discussing ways to choose design patterns when building an enterprise application from scratch, looking closely at the real world tradeoffs that Java developers must weigh when architecting their applications. Then they go on to show how to apply the patterns when writing realworld software. They also extend design patterns into areas not covered in other books, presenting original patterns for data modeling, transaction / process modeling, and interoperability.J2EE Design Patterns offers extensive coverage of the five problem areas enterprise developers face: Maintenance (Extensibility) Performance (System Scalability) Data Modeling (Business Object Modeling) Transactions (process Modeling) Messaging (Interoperability) And with its careful balance between theory and practice, J2EE Design Patterns will give developers new to the Java enterprise development arena a solid understanding of how to approach a wide variety of architectural and procedural problems, and will give experienced J2EE pros an opportunity to extend and improve on their existing experience."

Year's best science fiction : seventeenth annual collection,"Dozois, Gardner","In science fiction's early days, stories often looked past 1984 to the year 2000 as the far unknowable future. Here now, on the brink of the twenty-first century, the future remains as distant and as unknowable as ever . . . and science fiction stories continue to explore it with delightful results: Collected in this anthology are such imaginative gems as: ""The Wedding Album"" by David Marusek. In a high-tech future, the line between reality and simulation has grown thin . . . and it's often hard to tell who's on what side. ""Everywhere"" by Geoff Ryman. Do the people who live in utopian conditions ever recognize them as such? ""Hatching the Phoenix"" by Frederik Pohl. One of science fiction's Grand Masters returns with a star-crossing tale of the Heechee---the enigmatic, vanished aliens whose discarded technology guides mankind through the future. ""A Hero of the Empire"" by Robert Silverberg. Showing that the past is as much a province of the imagination as the future, this novelette returns to an alternate history when the Roman Empire never fell to show us just how the course of history can be altered. The twenty-seven stories in this collection imaginatively take us to nearby planets and distant futures, into the past and into universes no larger than a grain of sand. Included here are the works of masters of the form and of bright new talents. Supplementing the stories are the editor's insightful summation of the year's events and a lengthy list of honorable mentions, making this book a valuable resource in addition to serving as the single best place in the universe to find stories that stir the imagination and the heart."

GPRS in practice : a companion to the specifications,"McGuiggan, Peter","Professionals quickly discover that, although the technical specifications for GPRS cover all parts of the engineering functions in detail and depth, they are lacking in one important feature; the conceptual framework within which the specifications sit - GPRS in Practice fills this gap. By beginning with an explanation of why GPRS is necessary and describing the core concept of GPRS operations, the TBF (Temporary Block Flow), a revision section then covers the GSM Air Interface with its Radio, Physical and Logical channels and this progressively leads to the GPRS logical channels - what they do and how they do it. The book then moves on to a brief introduction of the GPRS protocol stack which provides a launch pad for a detailed trip into all the layers of this stack, with detailed diagrams and explanations of each layer integrated into an overall understanding of how the GPRS service operates in practice. Provides descriptions of why procedures are specified and then clearly explains how the specifications work in practice Provides a layered view of the GPRS protocol and deals in detail with each layer separately Includes numerous acronyms and abbreviations accompanied by their full meaning An invaluable resource for Mobile network operators, Development and deployment engineers and Handset designers."

Modern C++ design : generic programming and design patterns applied,"Alexandrescu, Andrei","Modern C++ Design, Andrei Alexandrescu opens new vistas for C++ programmers. Displaying extraordinary creativity and programming virtuosity, Alexandrescu offers a cutting-edge approach to design that unites design patterns, generic programming, and C++, enabling programmers to achieve expressive, flexible, and highly reusable code. This book introduces the concept of generic components–reusable design templates that produce boilerplate code for compiler consumption–all within C++. Generic components enable an easier and more seamless transition from design to application code, generate code that better expresses the original design intention, and support the reuse of design structures with minimal recoding. The author describes the specific C++ techniques and features that are used in building generic components and goes on to implement industrial strength generic components for real-world applications. Recurring issues that C++ developers face in their day-to-day activity are discussed in depth and implemented in a generic way. These include: Policy-based design for flexibility Partial template specialization Typelists–powerful type manipulation structures Patterns such as Visitor, Singleton, Command, and Factories Multi-method engines For each generic component, the book presents the fundamental problems and design options, and finally implements a generic solution. In addition, an accompanying Web site, http://www.awl.com/cseng/titles/0-201-70431-5, makes the code implementations available for the generic components in the book and provides a free, downloadable C++ library, called Loki, created by the author.

Fatal strategies,"Baudrillard, Jean","An early work in which Baudrillard became Baudrillard. When Fatal Strategies was first published in French in 1983, it represented a turning point for Jean Baudrillard: an utterly original, and for many readers, utterly bizarre book that offered a theory as proliferative, ecstatic, and hallucinatory as the postmodern world it endeavored to describe. Arguing against the predetermined outcomes of dialectical thought with his renowned, wry, ambivalent passion, with this volume Jean Baudrillard mounted an attack against the “false problems” posed by Western philosophy. If his Marxist days were firmly behind him, Baudrillard here indicated that metaphysics had also gone the way of sociology and politics: the contemporary world demanded nothing less than Pataphysics, Alfred Jarry's absurdist philosphy that described the laws of the universe supplementary to this one. In effect, with Fatal Strategies, Baudrillard became Baudrillard. In his extrapolationist manner, Baudrillard sought to replace Western philosophy's circular arguments with a ritualistic Theater of Cruelty. Using this line of thought developed in Fatal Strategies, Baudrillard went on, throughout the 1980s, to find new and shatteringly accurate ways of discussing American corporatocracy, arms build-up, and hostage taking. Fatal Strategies asserts a profound critique of American politics, and it is an important step towards his examination of evil.Jean Baudrillard (1929-2007) was a philosopher, sociologist, cultural critic, and theorist of postmodernity who challenged all existing theories of contemporary society with humor and precision. An outsider in the French intellectual establishment, he was internationally renowned as a twenty-first century visionary, reporter, and provocateur. His Simulations (1983) instantly became a cult classic and made him a controversial voice in the world of politics and art."

Introduction to abstract algebra,"Janusz, Gerald J.","This is the classic text for the first undergraduate course in abstract algebra; it follows the rings before groups philosophy that relies on the student's familiarity with the ring of integers to make the abstract axioms feel more concrete. The text and exercises are coordinated to help the student learn to read and write mathematical proofs. To achieve an understanding of the methods of proof, the unique factorization theorems are presented several times in different contexts. The integers are covered first, then polynomial rings over a field and, in the final chapter, factorization in principal ideal domains. Results on finite fields up through existence and uniqueness are proved without the use of linear algebra. The material on groups is studied in three chapters, the first giving definitions and examples, including permutation groups; the second gives the classification of finite abelian groups; the third discusses groups acting on sets and gives the proofs of the Sylow theorems. There are many worked examples and a large number of exercises of varying levels of difficulty. By carefully selecting sections to be covered in class lectures, an instructor will find this text suitable for almost any syllabus giving an introduction to abstract algebra."

Semiconductor optoelectronic devices : introduction to physics and simulation,"Piprek, Joachim","Optoelectronics has become an important part of our lives. Wherever light is used to transmit information, tiny semiconductor devices are needed to transfer electrical current into optical signals and vice versa. Examples include light emitting diodes in radios and other appliances, photodetectors in elevator doors and digital cameras, and laser diodes that transmit phone calls through glass fibers. Such optoelectronic devices take advantage of sophisticated interactions between electrons and light. Nanometer scale semiconductor structures are often at the heart of modern optoelectronic devices. Their shrinking size and increasing complexity make computer simulation an important tool to design better devices that meet ever rising perfomance requirements. The current need to apply advanced design software in optoelectronics follows the trend observed in the 1980's with simulation software for silicon devices. Today, software for technology computer-aided design (TCAD) and electronic design automation (EDA) represents a fundamental part of the silicon industry. In optoelectronics, advanced commercial device software has emerged recently and it is expected to play an increasingly important role in the near future. This book will enable students, device engineers, and researchers to more effectively use advanced design software in optoelectronics. - Provides fundamental knowledge in semiconductor physics and in electromagnetics, while helping to understand and use advanced device simulation software - Demonstrates the combination of measurements and simulations in order to obtain realistic results and provides data on all required material parameters - Gives deep insight into the physics of state-of-the-art devices and helps to design and analyze of modern optoelectronic devices"

Spelling,"Allen, Robert","Good spelling is fundamental to making the right impression with any type of writing; reports, homework, CVs, and letters all require correct spelling in order to get the message across in clear and straightforward English. Adaptable or adaptible? Definite or definate? Delirious or delireous? What is the difference between assent and ascent, dual and duel, or forbear and forebear? How do you make the plural of halo? Is it halos or haloes? Actually it's both, but not so for potato, the plural of which is potatoes. Knowing the difference between easily confusable words, making plurals, and adding endings are just some of the aspects of spelling that confront us with endless pitfalls. This easy-to-use A-Z guide does what no spellchecker can do: it gives immediate access not only to individual word spellings but also to general rules that will help you develop good spelling. The book covers the topics in simple and helpful terms and also offers advice on how to use apostrophes and hyphens, and the differences between British and American spelling. The core of the book is a list of over 2,000 words laid out for quick and easy reference. Based on evidence of misspelling gathered from real situations, this guide is the most useful and comprehensive help on spelling available. This new edition makes the benefits of the material more explicit to the general reader: better organization of the supplementary features, simplified and more transparent design, additional and updated content, and more clearly written rules."
Morphological image analysis : principles and applications.,"Soille, Pierre","The book is self-contained in the sense that it is accessible to engineers, scientists, and practitioners having no prior experience with morphology. In addition, most necessary background notions about digital image processing are covered. The emphasis being put on the techniques useful for solving practical problems rather than the theory underlying mathematical morphology, no special knowledge about set theory and topology is required. Nevertheless, the book goes well beyond an introduction to mathematical morphology. Indeed, starting from the fundamental transformations, more elaborate methods which have proven their practical usefulness are explained. This is achieved through a step by step process pursued until the most recent advances."

Emerging optimization techniques in production planning and control,"Onwubolu, Godfrey C.","This book proposes a concept of adaptive memory programming (AMP) for grouping a number of generic optimization techniques used in combinatorial problems. The same common features seen in the use of memory and a local search procedure drive these emerging optimization techniques, which include artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms, tabu search and ant systems. The primary motivation for AMP, therefore, is to group and unify all these techniques so as to enhance the computational capabilities that they offer for combinatorial problems encountered in real life in the area of production planning and control.The text describes the theoretical aspects of AMP together with relevant production planning and control applications. It covers the techniques, applications and algorithms. The book has been written in such a way that it can serve as an instructional text for students and those who are taking tuition on their own. The numerical examples given are first solved manually to enhance the reader's understanding of the material, and that is followed by a description of the algorithms and computer results. This way, the student can fully follow the material. The algorithms described for each application are useful to both students and practitioners in grasping how to implement similar applications in computer code using emerging optimization techniques."

Cult of the saints : its rise and function in latin christianity,"Brown, Peter","Following the fall of the Roman Empire in the West, the cult of the saints was the dominant form of religion in Christian Europe. In this elegantly written work, Peter Brown explores the role of tombs, shrines, relics, and pilgrimages connected with the sacred bodies of the saints. He shows how men and women living in harsh and sometimes barbaric times relied upon the merciful intercession of the holy dead to obtain justice, forgiveness, and to find new ways to accept their fellows. Challenging the common treatment of the cult as an outbreak of superstition among the lower classes, Brown demonstrates how this form of religiousity engaged the finest minds of the Church and elicited from members of the educated upper classes some of their most splendid achievements in poetry, literature, and the patronage of the arts. ""Brown has an international reputation for his fine style, a style he here turns on to illuminate the cult of the saints. Christianity was born without such a cult; it took rise and that rise needs chronicling. Brown has a gift for the memorable phrase and sees what the passersby have often overlooked. An eye-opener on an important but neglected phase of Western development.""—The Christian Century ""Brilliantly original and highly sophisticated . . . . [The Cult of the Saints] is based on great learning in several disciplines, and the story is told with an exceptional appreciation for the broad social context. Students of many aspects of medieval culture, especially popular religion, will want to consult this work.""—Bennett D. Hill, Library Journal"

J2EE design patterns applied,"Berry, Craig A.","2012 Jolt Award Finalist! Even experienced software professionals find it difficult to apply patterns in ways that deliver substantial value to their organizations. In Elemental Design Patterns, Jason McC. Smith addresses this problem head-on, helping developers harness the true power of patterns, map them to real software implementations more cleanly and directly, and achieve far better results. Part tutorial, part example-rich cookbook, this resource will help developers, designers, architects, and analysts successfully use patterns with a wide variety of languages, environments, and problem domains. Every bit as important, it will give them a deeper appreciation for the work they’ve chosen to pursue. Smith presents the crucial missing link that patterns practitioners have needed: a foundational collection of simple core patterns that are broken down to their core elements. If you work in software, you may already be using some of these elemental design patterns every day. Presenting them in a comprehensive methodology for the first time, Smith names them, describes them, explains their importance, helps you compare and choose among them, and offers a framework for using them together. He also introduces an innovative Pattern Instance Notation diagramming system that makes it easier to work with patterns at many levels of granularity, regardless of your goals or role. If you’re new to patterns, this example-rich approach will help you master them piece by piece, logically and intuitively. If you’re an experienced patterns practitioner, Smith follows the Gang of Four format you’re already familiar with, explains how his elemental patterns can be composed into conventional design patterns, and introduces highly productive new ways to apply ideas you’ve already encountered. No matter what your level of experience, this infinitely practical book will help you transform abstract patterns into high-value solutions."

"Violence in urban India : identity politics, Mumbai and the postcolonical city","Hansen, Thomas Blom","When Bombay changed its name to Mumbai in 1995, it was the culmination of a long process that transformed India's primary symbol of modernity and cultural diversity into a site of intense ethnic conflict and violent nationalism. Wages of Violence is a startling account of how the city's atmosphere, dominant public languages, and power structures have changed since the 1960s. The book centers on how Shiv Sena, a militant Hindu movement, has advanced a new, ''plebeian'' political culture and has undermined democratic rule in India's premier city. Drawing on a large body of archival material and conversations with people from all walks of life, Thomas Blom Hansen paints a vivid picture of this dynamic and violent movement. Challenging conventional views of recent trends in Indian politics, Hansen shows that the xenophobic public culture of today's Mumbai has deep roots in the region's history and its contested identities. We are also given revealing insights into the city's Muslim communities and the authorities' understanding and control of the ethno-religious subcultures in the city. Hansen argues cogently that Shiv Sena's success represents the violent possibilities of the ''vernacularization'' of democracy in India. Unfolding at a juncture where the globalization of India's economy is having a deepening impact on the lives of ordinary people, this is a story that resonates with the directions urban growth is taking both elsewhere in India and beyond."

Introduction to bioinformatics algorithms,"Pevzner, Pavel A.","An introductory text that emphasizes the underlying algorithmic ideas that are driving advances in bioinformatics. This introductory text offers a clear exposition of the algorithmic principles driving advances in bioinformatics. Accessible to students in both biology and computer science, it strikes a unique balance between rigorous mathematics and practical techniques, emphasizing the ideas underlying algorithms rather than offering a collection of apparently unrelated problems. The book introduces biological and algorithmic ideas together, linking issues in computer science to biology and thus capturing the interest of students in both subjects. It demonstrates that relatively few design techniques can be used to solve a large number of practical problems in biology, and presents this material intuitively. An Introduction to Bioinformatics Algorithms is one of the first books on bioinformatics that can be used by students at an undergraduate level. It includes a dual table of contents, organized by algorithmic idea and biological idea; discussions of biologically relevant problems, including a detailed problem formulation and one or more solutions for each; and brief biographical sketches of leading figures in the field. These interesting vignettes offer students a glimpse of the inspirations and motivations for real work in bioinformatics, making the concepts presented in the text more concrete and the techniques more approachable.PowerPoint presentations, practical bioinformatics problems, sample code, diagrams, demonstrations, and other materials can be found at the Author's website."

Governing globalization : issues and institutions,"Nayyar, Deepak","It is now more than fifty years since the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions were created. The world has changed since then, and so have its governance needs in terms of institutions and rules. It is time to think about the contours of institutions and governance that would meet the needs of the world economy, and also polity, at least for the first quarter of the twenty-first century. This book is among the first to examine the subject in depth. The study is divided into four parts. The first situates the subject in the wider context of globalization which has shaped development in the world economy, affected the living conditions of people, and constrained the role of nation states. The international context and the national setting are explored. The second part analyses some issues of emerging significance in the contemporary world, such as global macroeconomic management, transnational corporations, international capital flows, and cross-border movements of people, to suggest that there are some missing institutions which are needed. The third part provides a critical evaluation of the existing institutions, in retrospect, with a focus on the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, and the WTO. It analyses how existing rules need to be modified or existing institutions need to be restructured to meet the present and future needs of global governance. The fourth part explores some important elements of governance which are critical for any vision of the future. It suggests some changes in existing institutions and points to emerging governance needs where new institutions may have to be created. This authoritative volume will be of value to readers with an interest in international economics, development economics, and international relations. It will also be of value to practitioners, both policy-makers and diplomats, concerned with problems of global governance, and should become the standard reference on the subject."

I recommend it wholeheartedly."" --Dr. Andy Evans, Managing Director, Xactium Limited, UK ""Excellent job of distilling MDA down to its core concepts."" --Krzysztof Czarnecki, Univeristy of Waterloo, coauthor of Generative Programming (Addison-Wesley, 2000) As systems have grown more crucial to the operations of organizations worldwide, so too have the costs associated with building and maintaining them. Enter model-driven architecture (MDA), a standard framework from the Object Management Group (OMG) that allows developers to link object models together to build complete systems. MDA prevents design decisions from being intertwined with the application and keeps it independent of its implementation. The result is an application that can be combined with other technologies as well as other applications, and models that become highly reusable assets. MDA Distilled is an accessible introduction to the MDA standard and its tools and technologies. The book describes the fundamental features of MDA, how they fit together, and how you can use them in your organization today. You will also learn how to define a model-driven process for a project involving multiple platforms, implement that process, and then test the resulting system. MDA Distilled will help you understand: The MDA framework, including the platform-independent model (PIM) and the platform-specific model (PSM) The Meta Object Facility (MOF)--the OMG's adopted standard for metamodeling Horizontal, vertical, and merging mappings between models Building marks and marking models Elaborating models, including viewing generated models, and managing manual changes Building executable models with Executable UML Agile MDA development Developers and architects can dramatically improve productivity, portability, interoperability, and maintenance with MDA. Find out how with this essential reference, and quickly learn how to harness the significant power of this new framework."

Economic growth,"Sala-i-Martin, Xavier","The long-awaited second edition of an important textbook on economic growth—a major revision incorporating the most recent work on the subject. This graduate level text on economic growth surveys neoclassical and more recent growth theories, stressing their empirical implications and the relation of theory to data and evidence. The authors have undertaken a major revision for the long-awaited second edition of this widely used text, the first modern textbook devoted to growth theory. The book has been expanded in many areas and incorporates the latest research. After an introductory discussion of economic growth, the book examines neoclassical growth theories, from Solow-Swan in the 1950s and Cass-Koopmans in the 1960s to more recent refinements; this is followed by a discussion of extensions to the model, with expanded treatment in this edition of heterogenity of households. The book then turns to endogenous growth theory, discussing, among other topics, models of endogenous technological progress (with an expanded discussion in this edition of the role of outside competition in the growth process), technological diffusion, and an endogenous determination of labor supply and population. The authors then explain the essentials of growth accounting and apply this framework to endogenous growth models. The final chapters cover empirical analysis of regions and empirical evidence on economic growth for a broad panel of countries from 1960 to 2000. The updated treatment of cross-country growth regressions for this edition uses the new Summers-Heston data set on world income distribution compiled through 2000."

Negotiation analysis : the science and art of collaborative decision making,"Richardson, John","This masterly book substantially extends Howard Raiffa's earlier classic, The Art and Science of Negotiation. It does so by incorporating three additional supporting strands of inquiry: individual decision analysis, judgmental decision making, and game theory. Each strand is introduced and used in analyzing negotiations. The book starts by considering how analytically minded parties can generate joint gains and distribute them equitably by negotiating with full, open, truthful exchanges. The book then examines models that disengage step by step from that ideal. It also shows how a neutral outsider (intervenor) can help all negotiators by providing joint, neutral analysis of their problem. Although analytical in its approach--building from simple hypothetical examples--the book can be understood by those with only a high school background in mathematics. It therefore will have a broad relevance for both the theory and practice of negotiation analysis as it is applied to disputes that range from those between family members, business partners, and business competitors to those involving labor and management, environmentalists and developers, and nations."

Nature of order : vision of a living world : an essay on the art of building and the nature of the universe,"Alexander, Christopher","Christopher Alexander's series of ground-breaking books including A Pattern Language and The Timeless Way of Building have pointed to fundamental truths of the way we build, revealing what gives life and beauty and true functionality to our buildings and towns. Now, in The Nature of Order, Alexander explores the properties of life itself, highlighting a set of well-defined structures present in all order - and in all life - from micro-organisms and mountain ranges to good houses and vibrant communities. From a practical point of view, A Vision of a Living World is the most compelling of the four books. Hundreds of photographs and plans of new buildings that have living structure, and the processes which gave them life, demonstrate, for the first time, what the concept of living structure can mean in buildings of our time and of the future. The really good building. The really good space. Places that reach an archetypal level of human experience, reaching across centuries, across continents, across cultures, across technology, across building materials and climates. They connect us to ourselves. They connect us to our feelings. What is more, as we study them, we realize that they all share a similar geometry. How are they made? The practical task of making beauty is the principal subject of this volume. Hundreds of examples of buildings and places are shown. New forms for large buildings, public spaces, communities, neighborhoods, lead to discussions about equally important small scale of detail and ornament and colour. Many of the examples are built by Alexander and his colleagues; other buildings explored take us around the world and through time. With these examples, lay people, architects, builders, artists, and students are able to make this new framework real for themselves, understand how it works, and understand its significance. The book is a feast for the eyes, and mind, and heart. Places created by living process (Book 2) have living structure (Book 1), and they connect us to our essence as people (Book 4). The seven hundred pictures of Alexander's buildings and works of art shown in this book demonstrate in detail what he means. Taken as a whole, the four books create a sweeping new conception of the nature of things which is both objective and structural (hence part of science) and also personal (in that it shows how and why things have the power to touch the human heart). A step has been taken, through which these two domains - the domain of geometrical structure and the feeling it creates - kept separate during four centuries of scientific though from 1600 to 2000, have finally been united. The Nature of Order constitutes the backbone of Building Beauty: Ecologic Design Construction Process, an initiative aimed at radically reforming architecture education, with the emphasis of making as a way to access a transformative vision of the world. The 15 fundamental properties of life guide our work and have given us much more than a set of solutions. The Nature of Order has given us the framework in which we can search and build up our own solutions. In order to be authentically sustainable, buildings and places have to be cared for and loved over generations. Beautiful buildings and places are more likely to be loved, and they become more beautiful, and loved, through the attention given to them over time. Beauty is therefore, not a luxury, or an option, it includes and transcends technological innovation, and is a necessary requirement for a truly sustainable culture."
Nature of order : luminous ground : an essay on the art of building and the nature of the universe,"Alexander, Christopher","Christopher Alexander's series of ground-breaking books including A Pattern Language and The Timeless Way of Building have pointed to fundamental truths of the way we build, revealing what gives life and beauty and true functionality to our buildings and towns. Now, in The Nature of Order, Alexander explores the properties of life itself, highlighting a set of well-defined structures present in all order - and in all life - from micro-organisms and mountain ranges to good houses and vibrant communities. The foundations of modern scientific thought are firmly rooted in a conception that the universe is a machinelike entity, a play of baubles, machines, trinkets. To this day, our real daily experience of ourselves has no clear place in science. It is little wonder that a machine-like worldview has supported the deadly architecture of the last century. This mechanistic thinking and the consequent investment-oriented tracts of houses, condominiums and offices have dehumanized our cities and our lives. How are spirit, soul, emotion, feeling to be introduced into a building, or a street, or a development project, in modern times? The Luminous Ground, the fourth book of The Nature of Order, contains what is perhaps the deepest revelation in the four-volume work. Here is a geometrical view of space and matter seamlessly connected to our own private, personal experience as sentient and knowing creatures. This is not merely an emotional appendix to the scientific theory of the other books. It is at the core of the entire work, and is rooted in the fact that our two sides - our analytical thinking selves, and our vulnerable emotional personalities as human beings - are coterminous. They must be harnessed at one and the same time if we are ever to really make sense of what is around us, and be able to create a living world. Alexander breaks away completely from the one-sided mechanical model of buildings or neighbourhoods as mere assemblages of technically generated interchangeable parts. He shows us conclusively that a spiritual, emotional, and personal basis must underlie every act of building. His buildings and works of art demonstrate in detail what he means. And then, in the middle of the book, comes the linchpin of the work: a one-hundred page chapter on colour, which lavishly illustrates and dramatically conveys the way that consciousness and spirit can make their appearance in the world. Altogether, present throughout this fourth and final book, is a new cosmology uniting matter and consciousness: consciousness inextricably joined to the substrate of matter, present in all matter, and providing all wholeness with its material, cognitive, and spiritual underpinnings. This view, though radical, conforms to our most ordinary daily intuitions. It may provide a path for those contemporary scientists who are beginning to see consciousness as the underpinning of all matter, and thus as a proper object of scientific study. Taken as a whole, the four books create a sweeping new conception of the nature of things which is both objective and structural (hence part of science) and also personal (in that it shows how and why things have the power to touch the human heart). A step has been taken, through which these two domains - the domain of geometrical structure and the feeling it creates - kept separate during four centuries of scientific though from 1600 to 2000, have finally been united. The Nature of Order constitutes the backbone of Building Beauty: Ecologic Design Construction Process, an initiative aimed at radically reforming architecture education, with the emphasis of making as a way to access a transformative vision of the world.

Food security in nutrient-stressed environments : exploiting plants' genetic capabilities,"Adu-Gyamfi, J. J.","Ultimate success in exploiting the genetic capabilities of plants to grow in nutrient-stressed environments of the semi-arid tropics (SAT) requires a holistic view of food systems to ensure that genetic selections for improved yields on nutrient-poor soils will actually be adopted by farmers. This book sets out to address the important issue of how physiological mechanisms of nutrient uptake can best be combined with genetic options to improve the adaptation of crops to low-nutrient availability, thereby enhancing productivity of nutrient poor soils in the semi-arid tropics. The book examines (i) the sustainability of breeding for low-nutrient environments from the viewpoint of three interrelated disciplines; physiology, breeding, and socio-economics, (ii) candidate mechanisms and physiological traits to enhance uptake and utilization efficiencies, (iii) genetic approaches for manipulation of crop plants to enhance root exudation and access nutrients in the rhizosphere, and (iv) field practices and farmers' preferences for crop varieties grown in low-nutrient environments. Finally, the role of modelling in improving nutrient efficiency in cropping systems, recommendations for future research needs and strategies were highlighted. Attended by 50 international participants, this book is the outcome of the workshop held at ICRISAT-India during 27-30 September 1999 to mark the culmination of the Government of Japan/ICRISAT Project."

Galois theory,"Rotman, Joseph","A clear, efficient exposition of this topic with complete proofs and exercises, covering cubic and quartic formulas; fundamental theory of Galois theory; insolvability of the quintic; Galoiss Great Theorem; and computation of Galois groups of cubics and quartics. Suitable for first-year graduate students, either as a text for a course or for study outside the classroom, this new edition has been completely rewritten in an attempt to make proofs clearer by providing more details. It now begins with a short section on symmetry groups of polygons in the plane, for there is an analogy between polygons and their symmetry groups and polynomials and their Galois groups - an analogy which serves to help readers organise the various field theoretic definitions and constructions. The text is rounded off by appendices on group theory, ruler-compass constructions, and the early history of Galois Theory. The exposition has been redesigned so that the discussion of solvability by radicals now appears later and several new theorems not found in the first edition are included."
Game theory,"Fudenberg, Drew","This advanced text introduces the principles of noncooperative game theory in a direct and uncomplicated style that will acquaint students with the broad spectrum of the field while highlighting and explaining what they need to know at any given point. This advanced text introduces the principles of noncooperative game theory—including strategic form games, Nash equilibria, subgame perfection, repeated games, and games of incomplete information—in a direct and uncomplicated style that will acquaint students with the broad spectrum of the field while highlighting and explaining what they need to know at any given point. The analytic material is accompanied by many applications, examples, and exercises. The theory of noncooperative games studies the behavior of agents in any situation where each agent's optimal choice may depend on a forecast of the opponents' choices. ""Noncooperative"" refers to choices that are based on the participant's perceived selfinterest. Although game theory has been applied to many fields, Fudenberg and Tirole focus on the kinds of game theory that have been most useful in the study of economic problems. They also include some applications to political science. The fourteen chapters are grouped in parts that cover static games of complete information, dynamic games of complete information, static games of incomplete information, dynamic games of incomplete information, and advanced topics."

Topology and geometry,"Bredon, Glen E.","The golden age of mathematics-that was not the age of Euclid, it is ours. C. J. KEYSER This time of writing is the hundredth anniversary of the publication (1892) of Poincare's first note on topology, which arguably marks the beginning of the subject of algebraic, or ""combinatorial,"" topology. There was earlier scattered work by Euler, Listing (who coined the word ""topology""), Mobius and his band, Riemann, Klein, and Betti. Indeed, even as early as 1679, Leibniz indicated the desirability of creating a geometry of the topological type. The establishment of topology (or ""analysis situs"" as it was often called at the time) as a coherent theory, however, belongs to Poincare. Curiously, the beginning of general topology, also called ""point set topology,"" dates fourteen years later when Frechet published the first abstract treatment of the subject in 1906. Since the beginning of time, or at least the era of Archimedes, smooth manifolds (curves, surfaces, mechanical configurations, the universe) have been a central focus in mathematics. They have always been at the core of interest in topology. After the seminal work of Milnor, Smale, and many others, in the last half of this century, the topological aspects of smooth manifolds, as distinct from the differential geometric aspects, became a subject in its own right."

Professional PHP5,"Cove, Alec","What is this book about? With the release of PHP 5 and the Zend Engine 2, PHP finally graduates from it earliest days as a lightweight scripting syntax to an powerful object oriented programming language that can hold its own against the Java and .NET architectures that currently dominate corporate software development. This book has a pragmatic focus on how to use PHP in the larger scheme of enterprise-class software development. What does this book cover? Unlike Java or .NET, there is little discussion of the application of design patterns, component architectures, and best-practices to the development of applications using PHP. Software written in the absence of this sort of higher-order architecture will never be able to match the robust frameworks that Java and .NET ship with out of the box. This book addresses this issue by covering the following material: Part 1 discusses the OO concepts that were initially explored in Beginning PHP 5 and a demonstration of how to implement them in PHP 5. This section also covers UML modeling and provides a brief introduction to project management techniques that are covered in more depth in Part 4. Parts 2 and 3 present objects and object hierarchies that, when completed, comprise a robust toolkit that developers will be able to reuse on future projects. These chapters are designed to arm the professional PHP developer with the sort of constructs that are available out of the box with platforms such as Java and .NET — from simple utility classes like Collection and Iterator, to more complex constructs like Model/View/Controller architectures and state machines. Part 4 shows how to use the toolkit from Parts 2 and 3 to create real-world applications. We look at the development of a robust contact management system that will leverage the componentry and concepts already discussed and introduce project management and software architecture concepts that enable developers to accurately identify business requirements, design scalable, extensible platforms, and handle change management effectively. It covers the waterfall and spiral project management paradigms and include a discussion on eXtreme Programming and other approaches to software development. The Appendices include an extended discussion on the effective use of CVS, introduce the Zend Studio IDE and related tools, and discuss performance tuning and scalability."
Beginning XML,"Hunter, David","What is this book about? Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a rapidly maturing technology with powerful real-world applications, particularly for the management, display, and organization of data. Together with its many related technologies it is an essential technology for anyone using markup languages on the web or internally. This book teaches you all you need to know about XML — what it is, how it works, what technologies surround it, and how it can best be used in a variety of situations, from simple data transfer to using XML in your web pages. It builds on the strengths of the first edition, and provides new material to reflect the changes in the XML landscape — notably SOAP and Web Services, and the publication of the XML Schemas Recommendation by the W3C. What does this book cover? Here are just a few of the things this book covers: XML syntax and writing well-formed XML Using XML Namespaces Transforming XML into other formats with XSLT XPath and XPointer for locating specific XML data XML Validation using DTDs and XML Schemas Manipulating XML documents with the DOM and SAX 2.0 SOAP and Web Services Displaying XML using CSS and XSL Incorporating XML into tradition databases and n-tier architectures XLink and XPointer for linking XML and non-XML resources Who is this book for? Beginning XML, 2nd Edition is for any developer who is interested in learning to use XML in web, e-commerce or data-storage applications. Some knowledge of mark up, scripting, and/or object oriented programming languages is advantageous, but not essential, as the basis of these techniques are explained as required."

Probabilistic reasoning in intelligent systems : networks of plausible inference,"Pearl, Judea","Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems is a complete and accessible account of the theoretical foundations and computational methods that underlie plausible reasoning under uncertainty. The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty--and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition--in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability."

Quasimodo, the deformed bell ringer of Notre-Dame Cathedral, having fallen in love with the kindhearted Esmeralda, tries to save her by hiding her in the cathedral’s tower. When a crowd of Parisian peasants, misunderstanding Quasimodo’s motives, attacks the church in an attempt to liberate her, the story ends in tragedy."
Candide,Voltaire,"Candide is a French satire by Voltaire, a philosopher of the Age of Enlightenment. Candide is characterised by its sarcastic tone as well as by its erratic, fantastical and fast-moving plot. A picaresque novel with a story similar to that of a more serious Bildungsroman, it parodies many adventure and romance clichés, the struggles of which are caricatured in a tone that is mordantly matter-of-fact. Still, the events discussed are often based on historical happenings, such as the Seven Years' War and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. As philosophers of Voltaire's day contended with the problem of evil, so too does Candide in this short novel, albeit more directly and humorously. Voltaire ridicules religion, theologians, governments, armies, philosophies, and philosophers through allegory; most conspicuously, he assaults Leibniz and his optimism. As expected by Voltaire, Candide has enjoyed both great success and great scandal. Immediately after its secretive publication, the book was widely banned because it contained religious blasphemy, political sedition and intellectual hostility hidden under a thin veil of naïveté. However, with its sharp wit and insightful portrayal of the human condition, the novel has since inspired many later authors and artists to mimic and adapt it. Today, Candide is recognized as Voltaire's magnum opus and is often listed as part of the Western canon; it is among the most frequently taught works of French literature. The British poet and literary critic Martin Seymour-Smith listed Candide as one of the 100 most influential books ever written."

Picture of Dorian Gray,"Wilde, Oscar","An astounding novel of decadence, debauchery, and secrecy from one of Ireland's greatest writers. Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read Enthralled by his own exquisite portrait, Dorian Gray makes a Faustian bargain to sell his soul in exchange for eternal youth and beauty. Under the influence of Lord Henry Wotton, he is drawn into a corrupt double life, where he is able to indulge his desires while remaining a gentleman in the eyes of polite society. Only Dorian's picture bears the traces of his decadence. A knowing account of a secret life and an analysis of the darker side of late Victorian society. The Picture of Dorian Gray offers a disturbing portrait of an individual coming face to face with the reality of his soul. Shocking in its suggestion of unspeakable sin, this novel was later used as evidence against Wilde when he was tried for indecency in 1895.

Best short stories,"Maupassant, Guy de",This complete collection includes all of the stories by this nineteenth-century French master of the genre.
Odyssey,Homer,"Fresh from his triumphs in the Trojan War, Odysseus, King of Ithaca, wants nothing more than to return home to his family. Instead, he offends the sea god, Poseidon, who dooms him to years of shipwreck and wandering. Battling man-eating monsters, violent storms, and the supernatural seductions of sirens and sorceresses, Odysseus will need all his strength and cunning--and a little help from Mount Olympus--to make his way home and seize his kingdom from the schemers who seek to wed his queen and usurp his throne. Award-winning graphic artist Gareth Hinds masterfully reinterprets a story of heroism, adventure, and high action that has been told and retold for more than 2,500 years--though never quite like this. With bold imagery and an ear tuned to the music of Homer’s epic poem, Gareth Hinds reinterprets the ancient classic as it’s never been told before."
Diary of a young girl,"Frank, Anne","Anne Frank's The Diary of a Young Girl is among the most enduring documents of the twentieth century. Since its publication in 1947, it has been read by tens of millions of people all over the world. It remains a beloved and deeply admired testament to the indestructible nature of the human spirit. Restored in this Definitive Edition are diary entries that were omitted from the original edition. These passages, which constitute 30 percent more material, reinforce the fact that Anne was first and foremost a teenage girl, not a remote and flawless symbol. She fretted about and tried to cope with her own sexuality. Like many young girls, she often found herself in disagreements with her mother. And like any teenager, she veered between the carefree nature of a child and the full-fledged sorrow of an adult. Anne emerges more human, more vulnerable and more vital than ever. Anne Frank and her family, fleeing the horrors of Nazi occupation, hid in the back of an Amsterdam warehouse for two years. She was thirteen when she went into the Secret Annex with her family.

Three men in a boat,"Jerome, Jerome K.","Jerome Klapka Jerome (1859-1927) was an English author, best known for the humorous travelogue Three Men in a Boat. Three Men in a Boat begins: THERE were four of us -- George, and William Samuel Harris, and myself, and Montmorency. We were sitting in my room, smoking, and talking about how bad we were -- bad from a medical point of view I mean, of course. We were all feeling seedy, and we were getting quite nervous about it. Harris said he felt such extraordinary fits of giddiness come over him at times, that he hardly knew what he was doing; and then George said that HE had fits of giddiness too, and hardly knew what HE was doing. With me, it was my liver that was out of order. I knew it was my liver that was out of order, because I had just been reading a patent liver-pill circular, in which were detailed the various symptoms by which a man could tell when his liver was out of order. I had them all. It is a most extraordinary thing, but I never read a patent medicine advertisement without being impelled to the conclusion that I am suffering from the particular disease therein dealt with in its most virulent form. The diagnosis seems in every case to correspond exactly with all the sensations that I have ever felt."

Prince,"Machiavelli, Niccoli","Based upon Machiavelli's first-hand experience as an emissary of the Florentine Republic to the courts of Europe, The Prince analyses the usually violent means by which men seize, retain, and lose political power. This fluent new translation is accompanied by comprehensive notes and an introduction that dispels some of the myths associated with Machiavelli, and considers the true purpose of The Prince. - ;'A prince must not have any other object nor any other thought...but war, its institutions, and its discipline; because that is the only art befitting one who commands.' When Machiavelli's brief treatise on Renaissance statecraft and princely power was posthumously published in 1532, it generated a debate that has raged unabated until the present day. Based upon Machiavelli's first-hand experience as an emissary of the Florentine Republic to the courts of Europe, The Prince analyses the usually violent means by which men seize, retain, and lose political power. Machiavelli added a dimension of incisive realism to one of the major philosophical and political issues of his time, especially the relationship between public deeds and private morality. His book provides a remarkably uncompromising picture of the true nature of power, no matter in what era or by whom it is exercised. This fluent new translation is accompanied by comprehensive notes and an introduction that considers the true purpose of The Prince and dispels some of the myths associated with it. - ;Literary scholar Peter Bondanella rightly seeks the cold elegance and readability of the original. Serious English readers will want both translations. - Lauro Martines, TLS"

Great expectations,"Dickens, Charles","Great Expectations was first published as a weekly serial in All the Year Round, December 1860 - August 1861. Its first appearance in volume form was as three-volume novel, without illustrations, in July 1861. A one-volume edition, the next year, preceded its inclusion in the collected editions of Dickens's lifetime. The three-volume 1861 edition is the basis of the present text: variant readings, including those in manuscript and extant proofs, are recorded in the textual apparatus, providing an unusually rich source of information on Dickens's methods of composition. The Introduction traces this process of composition and draws attention to the two unperformed dramatic adaptations: the reading version and the 1861 play version, made as a safeguard of copyright. Appendices include the original ending, the author's notes, and two textual examinations, one of the five so-called `editions' of 1861, the other a comparison of the one-volume 1862 edition with the 1864 Library edition."

It tells the story of young, impressionable Catherine Morland, whose first experience of fashionable society introduces her to the thrills of Gothic romances, and to the sophisticated Tilneys, who invite her to their family home, Northanger Abbey. But there, influenced by novels of horror and intrigue, Catherine begins to think that terrible crimes are being committed, and her imagination threatens to run away with her. Edited with an Introduction by MARILYN BUTLER"
Persuasion,"Austen, Jane","Twenty-seven-year old Anne Elliot is Austen's most adult heroine. Eight years before the story proper begins, she is happily betrothed to a naval officer, Frederick Wentworth, but she precipitously breaks off the engagement when persuaded by her friend Lady Russell that such a match is unworthy. The breakup produces in Anne a deep and long-lasting regret. When later Wentworth returns from sea a rich and successful captain, he finds Anne's family on the brink of financial ruin and his own sister a tenant in Kellynch Hall, the Elliot estate. All the tension of the novel revolves around one question: Will Anne and Wentworth be reunited in their love? Jane Austen once compared her writing to painting on a little bit of ivory, 2 inches square. Readers of Persuasion will discover that neither her skill for delicate, ironic observations on social custom, love, and marriage nor her ability to apply a sharp focus lens to English manners and morals has deserted her in her final finished work. About Jane Austen: Jane Austen was an English novelist whose works of romantic fiction, set among the landed gentry, earned her a place as one of the most widely read writers in English literature, her realism and biting social commentary cementing her historical importance among scholars and critics. Austen lived her entire life as part of a close-knit family located on the lower fringes of the English landed gentry. She was educated primarily by her father and older brothers as well as through her own reading. The steadfast support of her family was critical to her development as a professional writer. Her artistic apprenticeship lasted from her teenage years until she was about 35 years old. During this period, she experimented with various literary forms, including the epistolary novel which she tried then abandoned, and wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth. From 1811 until 1816, with the release of Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814) and Emma (1815), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, Northanger Abbey and Persuasion, both published posthumously in 1818, and began a third, which was eventually titled Sanditon, but died before completing it. "" One of the major sources of contention and strife in my marriage is the disagreement between my wife and me over what is the best Jane Austen novel (yes, we are both more than a bit geekish in our love of words and literature--our second biggest ongoing quarrel is about the merits of the serial comma). For my money, there are three of Austen's six finished novels that one can make a good argument for being her ""best"" ""Pride and Prejudice"" (the popular choice, and my wife's) ""Emma"" (the educated choice--most lit profs go with this one) ""Persuasion"" (the truly refined choice) Harrold Bloom in ""The Western Canon"" calls it perhaps a ""perfect novel,"" and while I disagree with some of his interpretations of the characters (yes, blasphemy, I know), I wholeheartedly concur with his overal assessment. While all of Austen's novels are generally comic, ""Persuasion book "" is the most nuanced. It's been described as ""autumnal"" and that word suits it. There's a bittersweetness to it that you just don't get in Austen's other work. "" "" Jane Austen books never disappoints me! This was the first time I've read this book, and, since it's one of her less popular novels, I didn't know what to expect. However, I quickly was swept up into the story and felt all of Anne's emotions like they were my own. I really enjoyed how, unlike the other Austen novels I've read, this one focuses on love lost and how, over time, people change in some ways but remain the same in other ways. """
Literary lapses and nonsense novels,"Leacock, Stephen","My Financial Career When I go into a bank I get rattled. The clerks rattle me; the wickets rattle me; the sight of the money rattles me; everything rattles me. The moment I cross the threshold of a bank and attempt to transact business there, I become an irresponsible idiot. I knew this beforehand, but my salary had been raised to fifty dollars a month and I felt that the bank was the only place for it. So I shambled in and looked timidly round at the clerks. I had an idea that a person about to open an account must needs consult the manager. I went up to a wicket marked ""Accountant."" The accountant was a tall, cool devil. The very sight of him rattled me. My voice was sepulchral. ""Can I see the manager?"" I said, and added solemnly, ""alone."" I don't know why I said ""alone."" ""Certainly,"" said the accountant, and fetched him. The manager was a grave, calm man. I held my fifty-six dollars clutched in a crumpled ball in my pocket. ""Are you the manager?"" I said. God knows I didn't doubt it. ""Yes,"" he said. ""Can I see you,"" I asked, ""alone?"" I didn't want to say ""alone"" again, but without it the thing seemed self-evident. The manager looked at me in some alarm. He felt that I had an awful secret to reveal. ""Come in here,"" he said, and led the way to a private room. He turned the key in the lock."

Dubliners,"Joyce, James","Dubliners is a collection of 15 short stories by James Joyce. They form a naturalistic depiction of Irish middle class life in and around Dublin in the early years of the 20th century. The stories were written when Irish nationalism was at its peak, and a search for a national identity and purpose was raging; at a crossroads of history and culture, Ireland was jolted by various converging ideas and influences. They centre on Joyce's idea of an epiphany: a moment where a character experiences self-understanding or illumination. Many of the characters in Dubliners later appear in minor roles in Joyce's novel Ulysses. The initial stories in the collection are narrated by child protagonists, and as the stories continue, they deal with the lives and concerns of progressively older people. This is in line with Joyce's tripartite division of the collection into childhood, adolescence and maturity. In Dubliners Joyce rarely uses hyperbole, relying on simplicity and close detail to create a realistic setting. This ties the reader's understanding of people to their environments. He does not tell readers what to think, rather they are left to come to their own conclusions. This is even more evident when contrasted with the moral judgements displayed by earlier writers such as Charles Dickens. This frequently leads to a lack of traditional dramatic resolution within the stories. The collection as a whole displays an overall plan, beginning with stories of youth and progressing in age to culminate in The Dead. Great emphasis is laid upon the specific geographic details of Dublin, details to which a reader with a knowledge of the area would be able to directly relate. The multiple perspectives presented throughout the collection serve to contrast the characters in Dublin at this time."

The Report focuses on three pillars of cooperation, each of which is in urgent need of renovation. The first pillar is international aid: the Milllennium Development Goals (MDGs) project has been compromised by chronic and sustained under-financing, allied to problems in aid quality. The second pillar is international trade. Under the right conditions, trade can act as a powerful catalyst for human development. The 'development round' of World Trade Organization talks, launched in 2001, provided northern governments with an opportunity to create those conditions. The third pillar is that of security: violent conflict is a source of systematic human rights violation and a barrier to progress towards the MDGs that must be overcome."

This pioneering novel, luminous in its detail and refreshingly free of artifice, is a gift to twentieth-century literature."
Pilgrimage,"Coelho, Paulo","From the Great Panathenaea of ancient Greece to the hajj of today, people of all religions and cultures have made sacred journeys to confirm their faith and their part in a larger identity. This book is a fascinating guide through the vast and varied cultural territory such pilgrimages have covered across the ages. The first book to look at the phenomenon and experience of pilgrimage through the multiple lenses of history, religion, sociology, anthropology, and art history, this sumptuously illustrated volume explores the full richness and range of sacred travel as it maps the cultural imagination. The authors consider pilgrimage as a physical journey through time and space, but also as a metaphorical passage resonant with meaning on many levels. It may entail a ritual transformation of the pilgrim's inner state or outer status; it may be a quest for a transcendent goal; it may involve the healing of a physical or spiritual ailment. Through folktales, narratives of the crusades, and the firsthand accounts of those who have made these journeys; through descriptions and pictures of the rituals, holy objects, and sacred architecture they have encountered, as well as the relics and talismans they have carried home, Pilgrimage evokes the physical and spiritual landscape these seekers have traveled. In its structure, the book broadly moves from those religions--Judaism, Christianity, and Islam--that cohere around a single canonical text to those with a multiplicity of sacred scriptures, like Hinduism and Buddhism. Juxtaposing the different practices and experiences of pilgrimage in these contexts, this book reveals the common structures and singular features of sacred travel from ancient times to our own."

India from midnight to millennium,"Throor, Shashi","At the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947, a new nation was born. It has seventeen major languages and 22,000 distinct dialects. It has over a billion individuals of every ethnic extraction known to humanity. It has a population that is 32 percent illiterate, but also one of the world’s largest pools of trained scientists and engineers. Its ageless civilization is the birthplace of four major religions, a dozen different traditions of classical dance, and three hundred ways of cooking a potato. Shashi Tharoor’s India is a fascinating portrait of one of the world’s most interesting countries—its politics, its mentality, and its cultural riches. An eloquent argument for the importance of India to the future of America and the industrialized world, the book flows with the energy and erudition that distinguished his prize-winning novels. A New York Times Notable Book, this work of remarkable depth and startling originality combines elements of political scholarship, personal reflection, memoir, fiction, and polemic, all illuminated in vivid and compelling prose."

Who is fourier? : a mathematical adventure,"Gleason, Alan","Many people give up on math in high school - they do not feel comfortable with it, or they do not see the need for it in everyday life. These ""mathematically-challenged"" people may have had little recourse available in the past. Now, however, there is LRF's Who is Fourier?, which takes readers gently by the hand and helps them with both simple and intimidating concepts alike. By using everyday examples it enables the reader to develop an understanding of the language of Fourier's wave analysis. For instance, Fourier Series is explained with a comparison to the contents of 'Veggie-veggie' juice! The student authors take the reader along on their adventure of discovery, creating an interactive work that gradually moves from the very basics (""What is a right triangle?"") to the more complicated mathematics of trigonometry, exponentiation, differentiation, and integration. This is done in a way that is not only easy to understand, but actually enjoyable."

Signals and systems,"Chen, Chi-Tsong","The third edition of Signals and Systems prepares students for real-world engineering applications. It is concise, focused, and practical. The text introduces basic concepts in signals and systems and their associated mathematical and computational tools. It also stresses the most important concepts in signal analysis (frequency spectra) and system analysis (stability and frequency responses) and uses them throughout, including the study of seismometers and accelerometers. Signals and Systems, 3/e, introduces every term carefully and develops every topic logically. It distinguishes amplitudes and magnitudes, as well as lumped and distributed systems. It presents engineering concepts as early as possible and discusses transform theory only as needed. Also, the text employs transfer functions and state-space equations only in the contexts where they are most efficient. Transfer functions are used exclusively in qualitative analysis and design, and state-space equations are used exclusively in computer computation and op-amp circuit implementation. Thus, the students' time is focused on learning only what can be immediately used. Including an author commentary on the best way to approach the text, Signals and Systems, 3/e, is ideal for sophomore- and junior-level undergraduate courses in systems and signals. It assumes a background in general physics (including simple circuit analysis), simple matrix operations, and basic calculus."
University chemistry,"Mahan, Bruce M.","A new approach to teaching university-level chemistry that links core concepts of chemistry and physical science to current global challenges. Introductory chemistry and physics are generally taught at the university level as isolated subjects, divorced from any compelling context. Moreover, the “formalism first” teaching approach presents students with disembodied knowledge, abstract and learned by rote. By contrast, this textbook presents a new approach to teaching university-level chemistry that links core concepts of chemistry and physical science to current global challenges. It provides the rigorous development of the principles of chemistry but places these core concepts in a global context to engage developments in technology, energy production and distribution, the irreversible nature of climate change, and national security. Each chapter opens with a “Framework” section that establishes the topic’s connection to emerging challenges. Next, the “Core” section addresses concepts including the first and second law of thermodynamics, entropy, Gibbs free energy, equilibria, acid-base reactions, electrochemistry, quantum mechanics, molecular bonding, kinetics, and nuclear. Finally, the “Case Studies” section explicitly links the scientific principles to an array of global issues. These case studies are designed to build quantitative reasoning skills, supply the technology background, and illustrate the critical global need for the infusion of technology into energy generation. The text’s rigorous development of both context and scientific principles equips students for advanced classes as well as future involvement in scientific and societal arenas. University Chemistry was written for a widely adopted course created and taught by the author at Harvard."
Probability and random processes for electrical and computer engineers,"Gubner, John A.","The theory of probability is a powerful tool that helps electrical and computer engineers to explain, model, analyze, and design the technology they develop. The text begins at the advanced undergraduate level, assuming only a modest knowledge of probability, and progresses through more complex topics mastered at graduate level. The first five chapters cover the basics of probability and both discrete and continuous random variables. The later chapters have a more specialized coverage, including random vectors, Gaussian random vectors, random processes, Markov Chains, and convergence. Describing tools and results that are used extensively in the field, this is more than a textbook; it is also a reference for researchers working in communications, signal processing, and computer network traffic analysis. With over 300 worked examples, some 800 homework problems, and sections for exam preparation, this is an essential companion for advanced undergraduate and graduate students. Further resources for this title, including solutions (for Instructors only), are available online at www.cambridge.org/9780521864701."

Evolutionary computation : a unified approach,"De Jong, Kenneth A.","A clear and comprehensive introduction to the field of evolutionary computation that takes an integrated approach. Evolutionary computation, the use of evolutionary systems as computational processes for solving complex problems, is a tool used by computer scientists and engineers who want to harness the power of evolution to build useful new artifacts, by biologists interested in developing and testing better models of natural evolutionary systems, and by artificial life scientists for designing and implementing new artificial evolutionary worlds. In this clear and comprehensive introduction to the field, Kenneth De Jong presents an integrated view of the state of the art in evolutionary computation. Although other books have described such particular areas of the field as genetic algorithms, genetic programming, evolution strategies, and evolutionary programming, Evolutionary Computation is noteworthy for considering these systems as specific instances of a more general class of evolutionary algorithms. This useful overview of a fragmented field is suitable for classroom use or as a reference for computer scientists and engineers."

Postmodern Gandhi and other essays : Gandhi in the world and at home.,"Rudolph, Lloyd I.","Gandhi, with his loincloth and walking stick, seems an unlikely advocate of postmodernism. But in Postmodern Gandhi, Lloyd and Susanne Rudolph portray him as just that in eight thought-provoking essays that aim to correct the common association of Gandhi with traditionalism. Combining core sections of their influential book Gandhi: The Traditional Roots of Charisma with substantial new material, the Rudolphs reveal here that Gandhi was able to revitalize tradition while simultaneously breaking with some of its entrenched values and practices. Exploring his influence both in India and abroad, they tell the story of how in London the young activist was shaped by the antimodern “other West” of Ruskin, Tolstoy, and Thoreau and how, a generation later, a mature Gandhi’s thought and action challenged modernity’s hegemony. Moreover, the Rudolphs argue that Gandhi’s critique of modern civilization in his 1909 book Hind Swaraj was an opening salvo of the postmodern era and that his theory and practice of nonviolent collective action (satyagraha) articulate and exemplify a postmodern understanding of situational truth. This radical interpretation of Gandhi's life will appeal to anyone who wants to understand Gandhi’s relevance in this century, as well as students and scholars of politics, history, charismatic leadership, and postcolonialism."

A fundamental question regarding zero-knowledge protocols refers to the preservation of security (i.e., of the zero-knowledge feature) when many - stances are executed concurrently, and in particular under a purely as- chronous model. The practical importance of this question, in the days of extensive Internet communication, seems clear. It turned out that this qu- tion is also very interesting from a theoretical point of view. In particular, this question served as a benchmark for the study of the security of concurrent executions of protocols and led to the development of techniques for coping with the problems that arise in that setting."

"Handbook of modern sensors : physics, designs, and applications","Fraden, Jacob","Since publication of the previous, the 3rd edition of this book, the sensor tech- logies have made a remarkable leap ahead. The sensitivity of the sensors became higher, the dimensions – smaller, the selectivity – better, and the prices – lower. What have not changed, are the fundamental principles of the sensor design. They still are governed by the laws of Nature. Arguably one of the greatest geniuses ever lived, Leonardo Da Vinci had his own peculiar way of praying. It went like this, “Oh Lord, thanks for Thou don’t violate Thy own laws. ” It is comforting indeed that the laws of Nature do not change with time, it is just that our appreciation of them becomes re?ned. Thus, this new edition examines the same good old laws of Nature that form the foundation for designs of various sensors. This has not changed much since the previous editions. Yet, the sections that describe practical designs are revised substantially. Recent ideas and developments have been added, while obsolete and less important designs were dropped. This book is about devices commonly called sensors. The invention of a microprocessor has brought highly sophisticated instruments into our everyday life. Numerous computerized appliances, of which microprocessors are integral parts, wash clothes and prepare coffee, play music, guard homes, and control room temperature. Sensors are essential components in any device that uses a digital signal processor."

C++ common knowledge : essential intermediate programming,"Dewhurst, Stephen C.","“I’m an enthusiastic supporter of the CERT Secure Coding Initiative. Programmers have lots of sources of advice on correctness, clarity, maintainability, performance, and even safety. Advice on how specific language features affect security has been missing. The CERT ® C Secure Coding Standard fills this need.” –Randy Meyers, Chairman of ANSI C “For years we have relied upon the CERT/CC to publish advisories documenting an endless stream of security problems. Now CERT has embodied the advice of leading technical experts to give programmers and managers the practical guidance needed to avoid those problems in new applications and to help secure legacy systems. Well done!” –Dr. Thomas Plum, founder of Plum Hall, Inc. “Connectivity has sharply increased the need for secure, hacker-safe applications. By combining this CERT standard with other safety guidelines, customers gain all-round protection and approach the goal of zero-defect software.” –Chris Tapp, Field Applications Engineer, LDRA Ltd. “I’ve found this standard to be an indispensable collection of expert information on exactly how modern software systems fail in practice. It is the perfect place to start for establishing internal secure coding guidelines. You won’t find this information elsewhere, and, when it comes to software security, what you don’t know is often exactly what hurts you.” –John McDonald, coauthor of The Art of Software Security Assessment Software security has major implications for the operations and assets of organizations, as well as for the welfare of individuals. To create secure software, developers must know where the dangers lie. Secure programming in C can be more difficult than even many experienced programmers believe. This book is an essential desktop reference documenting the first official release of The CERT® C Secure Coding Standard. The standard itemizes those coding errors that are the root causes of software vulnerabilities in C and prioritizes them by severity, likelihood of exploitation, and remediation costs. Each guideline provides examples of insecure code as well as secure, alternative implementations. If uniformly applied, these guidelines will eliminate the critical coding errors that lead to buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, integer overflow, and other common software vulnerabilities."

System of rice intensification in India : innovation history and institutional challenges,"Prasad, C. Shambu","Rice cultivation faces challenges across the world and India is no exception. With the increasing cost of cultivation of paddy coupled with labour scarcity, sustaining the interest of farmers in rice cultivation has become a challenge. Thus, there is an urgent need to produce more output with a drop of water owing to water scarcity. This study has envisaged to examine the issues in adoption and dis-adoption and its impact on resource use, yield and efficiency of SRI farmers in Palakkad district of Kerala, India. The present study revealed that SRI can be further adopted and practiced by farmers if there is an improvement in SRI extension service delivery. The main problem associated with discontinuance behaviour of farmers was shortage of skilled labour. Training and education to farmers on SRI techniques should be enhanced so that skilled labour is available for various operations and farmers can adopt SRI technologies to their own resource endowments and constraints to improve their rice production. The farmers should also be provided with essential institutional support through technology and capacity building."
"Topics in geometry, coding theory and cryptography","Garcia, Arnaldo","The theory of algebraic function fields over finite fields has its origins in number theory. However, after Goppa`s discovery of algebraic geometry codes around 1980, many applications of function fields were found in different areas of mathematics and information theory, such as coding theory, sphere packings and lattices, sequence design, and cryptography. The use of function fields often led to better results than those of classical approaches. This book presents survey articles on some of these new developments. Most of the material is directly related to the interaction between function fields and their various applications; in particular the structure and the number of rational places of function fields are of great significance. The topics focus on material which has not yet been presented in other books or survey articles. Wherever applications are pointed out, a special effort has been made to present some background concerning their use."

William Blake : the complete illuminated books,"Blake, William","This carefully crafted ebook: ""The Complete Illuminated Books of William Blake (Unabridged - With All The Original Illustrations)"" is formatted for your eReader with a functional and detailed table of contents. Taking his inspiration from the illuminated manuscripts of the middle ages, Blake invented the process of creating Illuminated Books. Between 1788 and early 1795 Blake published a series of fifteen Illuminated Books. He returned to creating Illuminated Books in 1804 when he began work on Milton (finished in 1808 or later) and Jerusalem. Blake committed himself in the minute particulars of producing his Illuminated Books. The process included creating a mental image, drawing, composing the design and poetry of the plate, engraving, printing, painting, compiling and selling. From inception to final production the color copy of Jerusalem was labored over for sixteen years. William Blake (1757 – 1827) was a British poet, painter, visionary mystic, and engraver, who illustrated and printed his own books. Blake proclaimed the supremacy of the imagination over the rationalism and materialism of the 18th-century. Largely unrecognised during his lifetime, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of both the poetry and visual arts of the Romantic Age."

Algebraic geometry,"Hartshorne, Robin","This is a description of the underlying principles of algebraic geometry, some of its important developments in the twentieth century, and some of the problems that occupy its practitioners today. It is intended for the working or the aspiring mathematician who is unfamiliar with algebraic geometry but wishes to gain an appreciation of its foundations and its goals with a minimum of prerequisites. Few algebraic prerequisites are presumed beyond a basic course in linear algebra."

Fourier and wavelet analysis,"Bachman, George","globalized Fejer's theorem; he showed that the Fourier series for any f E Ld-7I"", 7I""] converges (C, 1) to f (t) a.e. The desire to do this was part of the reason that Lebesgue invented his integral; the theorem mentioned above was one of the first uses he made of it (Sec. 4.18). Denjoy, with the same motivation, extended the integral even further. Concurrently, the emerging point of view that things could be decom posed into waves and then reconstituted infused not just mathematics but all of science. It is impossible to quantify the role that this perspective played in the development of the physics of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but it was certainly great. Imagine physics without it. We develop the standard features of Fourier analysis-Fourier series, Fourier transform, Fourier sine and cosine transforms. We do NOT do it in the most elegant way. Instead, we develop it for the reader who has never seen them before. We cover more recent developments such as the discrete and fast Fourier transforms and wavelets in Chapters 6 and 7. Our treatment of these topics is strictly introductory, for the novice. (Wavelets for idiots?) To do them properly, especially the applications, would take at least a whole book."
Introduction to mathematical methods in bioinformatics,"Isaev, Alexander","This book looks at the mathematical foundations of the models currently in use. All existing books on bioinformatics are software-orientated and they concentrate on computer implementations of mathematical models of biology. This book is unique in the sense that it looks at the mathematical foundations of the models, which are crucial for correct interpretation of the outputs of the models."

Introduction to statistical physics,"Salinas, Silvio R. A.","This textbook covers the basic principles of statistical physics and thermodynamics. The text is pitched at the level equivalent to first-year graduate studies or advanced undergraduate studies. It presents the subject in a straightforward and lively manner. After reviewing the basic probability theory of classical thermodynamics, the author addresses the standard topics of statistical physics. The text demonstrates their relevance in other scientific fields using clear and explicit examples. Later chapters introduce phase transitions, critical phenomena and non-equilibrium phenomena."
Intuitive analog circuit design : a problem-solving approach using design case studies,"Thompson, Marc T.","This book reflects Marc Thompson’s twenty years of experience designing and teaching analog circuit design. He describes intuitive and “back of the envelope techniques for designing and analyzing analog circuits, including transistor amplifiers (CMOS and bipolar), transistor switching, thermal circuit design, magnetic circuit design, control systems, and the like. The application of some simple rules-of-thumb and design techniques is the first step in developing an intuitive understanding of the behavior of complex electrical systems. This book outlines some ways of thinking about analog circuits and systems that hopefully develops such “circuit intuition and a “feel for what a good, working analog circuit design should be. *Introduces analog circuit design with a minimum of mathematics. *Gives readers an intuitive ""feel"" for analog circuit operation and rules-of-thumb for their design. *Uses numerous analogies from digital design to help readers whose main background is in digital make the transition to analog design. *Accompanying CD-ROM contains PowerPoint presentations for each chapter and MATLAB files used in the text."
Mathematical statistics,"Shao, Jun","This graduate textbook covers those topics in statistical theory essential for students preparing for work on a Ph.D. degree in statistics. The first chapter provides a quick overview of concepts and results in measure-theoretic probability theory that are useful in statistics, while the second introduces some fundamental concepts in statistical decision theory and inference. The remaining chapters contain detailed studies on such important topics as: unbiased estimation, parametric estimation, nonparametric estimation, hypothesis testing, and confidence sets. A large number of exercises in each chapter provide not only practice problems for students, but also many additional results. In addition to the classical results that are typically covered in a textbook of this level, this book introduces some topics in modern statistical theory that have been developed in recent years, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, quasi-likelihoods, empirical likelihoods, statistical functionals, generalized estimation equations, the jackknife, and the bootstrap."

Probability through problems,"Capinski, Marek","This book of problems has been designed to accompany an undergraduate course in probability. It will also be useful for students with interest in probability who wish to study on their own. The only prerequisite is basic algebra and calculus. This includes some elementary experience in set theory, sequences and series, functions of one variable, and their derivatives. Familiarity with integrals would be a bonus. A brief survey of terminology and notation in set theory and calculus is provided. Each chapter is divided into three parts: Problems, Hints, and Solutions. To make the book reasonably self-contained, all problem sections include expository material. Definitions and statements of important results are interlaced with relevant problems. The latter have been selected to motivate abstract definitions by concrete examples and to lead in manageable steps toward general results, as well as to provide exercises based on the issues and techniques introduced in each chapter. The hint sections are an important part of the book, designed to guide the reader in an informal manner. This makes Probability Through Prob lems particularly useful for self-study and can also be of help in tutorials. Those who seek mathematical precision will find it in the worked solutions provided. However, students are strongly advised to consult the hints prior to looking at the solutions, and, first of all, to try to solve each problem on their own."

Destined to accompany students making their way into this classical area of mathematics, the book offers quick access to the essential results for exam preparation. Teachers and interested mathematicians in finance, industry and science will profit from reading this again and again, and will refer back to it with pleasure."
Theory of point estimation,"Lehmann, E. L.","Since the publication in 1983 of Theory of Point Estimation, much new work has made it desirable to bring out a second edition. The inclusion of the new material has increased the length of the book from 500 to 600 pages; of the approximately 1000 references about 25% have appeared since 1983. The greatest change has been the addition to the sparse treatment of Bayesian inference in the first edition. This includes the addition of new sections on Equivariant, Hierarchical, and Empirical Bayes, and on their comparisons. Other major additions deal with new developments concerning the information in equality and simultaneous and shrinkage estimation. The Notes at the end of each chapter now provide not only bibliographic and historical material but also introductions to recent development in point estimation and other related topics which, for space reasons, it was not possible to include in the main text. The problem sections also have been greatly expanded. On the other hand, to save space most of the discussion in the first edition on robust estimation (in particu lar L, M, and R estimators) has been deleted. This topic is the subject of two excellent books by Hampel et al (1986) and Staudte and Sheather (1990). Other than subject matter changes, there have been some minor modifications in the presentation."
VLSI memory chip design,"Itoh, Kiyoo","The VLSI memory era truly began when the first production of semiconduc tor memory was announced by IBM and Intel in 1970. The announcement had a profound impact on my research at Hitachi Ltd. , and I was forced to change fields: from magnetic thin film to semiconductor memory. This change was so exceptionally sudden and difficult, I feIt like a victim of fate. Looking back, however, I realize how fortunate I was. I have witnessed an unprecedented increase in memory capacity (DRAM, for example, has had a 6-order increase in the last three decades - from the 1-Kb level in 1970 to the 1-Gb level today). I have contributed to this progress with full involvement in memory-chip development over my career. Such rapid progress would have been impossible without many of the inventions and innovative technologies, and without the effort of many talented people. Unfortunately, few systematic books on memory-chip design have been written by experts. Tliis is a result of two factors: the difficulty of involving university professors because of rapidly changing technology requiring huge investments and development resources, and a shortage of time on the part of chip designers in industry due to severe competition in the memory-chip business. Therefore, LSI memory-chip design has been isolated from the outside, preventing a deeper understanding of the technology. This book is based on my 30-year memory-chip (particularly DRAM) design career."

Hard times by Charles Dickens,"Dickens, Charles","Written deliberately to increase the circulation of Dickens's weekly magazine, ""Household Words, Hard Times"" was a huge and instantaneous success upon publication in 1854. Yet this novel is not the cheerful celebration of Victorian life one might have expected from the beloved author of ""The Pickwick Papers"" and ""The Old Curiosity Shop,"" Compressed, stark, allegorical, it is a bitter expose of capitalist exploitation during the industrial revolution-and a fierce denunciation of the philosophy of materialism, which threatens the human imagination in all times and places. With a typically unforgettable cast of characters-including the heartless fact-worshipper Mr. Gradgrind, the warmly endearing Sissy Jupe, and the eternally noble Stephen Blackpool-""Hard Times"" carries a uniquely powerful message and remains one of the most widely read of Dickens's major novels."

Starfish and the spider : the unstoppable power of leaderless organizations,"Brafman, Ori","If you cut off a spider’s leg, it’s crippled; if you cut off its head, it dies. But if you cut off a starfish’s leg it grows a new one, and the old leg can grow into an entirely new starfish. What’s the hidden power behind the success of Wikipedia, Craigslist, and Skype? What do eBay and General Electric have in common with the abolitionist and women’s rights movements? What fundamental choice put General Motors and Toyota on vastly different paths? How could winning a Supreme Court case be the biggest mistake MGM could have made? After five years of ground-breaking research, Ori Brafman and Rod Beckstrom share some unexpected answers, gripping stories, and a tapestry of unlikely connections. The Starfish and the Spider argues that organizations fall into two categories: traditional “spiders,” which have a rigid hierarchy and top-down leadership, and revolutionary “starfish,” which rely on the power of peer relationships. The Starfish and the Spider explores what happens when starfish take on spiders (such as the music industry vs. Napster, Kazaa, and the P2P services that followed). It reveals how established companies and institutions, from IBM to Intuit to the US government, are also learning how to incorporate starfish principles to achieve success. The book explores: * How the Apaches fended off the powerful Spanish army for 200 years * The power of a simple circle * The importance of catalysts who have an uncanny ability to bring people together * How the Internet has become a breeding ground for leaderless organizations * How Alcoholics Anonymous has reached untold millions with only a shared ideology and without a leader The Starfish and the Spider is the rare book that will change how you understand the world around you."

First course on fuzzy theory and applications,"Lee, Kwang H.","Fuzzy theory has become a subject that generates much interest among the courses for graduate students. However, it was not easy to find a suitable textbook to use in the introductory course and to recommend to the students who want to self-study. The main purpose of this book is just to meet that need. The author has given lectures on the fuzzy theory and its applications for ten years and continuously developed lecture notes on the subject. This book is a publication of the modification and summary of the lecture notes. The fundamental idea of the book is to provide basic and concrete concepts of the fuzzy theory and its applications, and thus the author focused on easy illustrations of the basic concepts. There are numerous examples and figures to help readers to understand and also added exercises at the end of each chapter. This book consists of two parts: a theory part and an application part. The first part (theory part) includes chapters from 1 to 8. Chapters 1 and 2 introduce basic concepts of fuzzy sets and operations, and Chapters 3 and 4 deal with the multi-dimensional fuzzy sets. Chapters 5 and 6 are extensions of the fuzzy theory to the number and function, and Chapters 7 and 8 are developments of fuzzy properties on the probability and logic theories."
Gandhi as disciple and mentor,"Weber, Thomas","Thomas Weber's book comprises a series of biographical reflections about people who influenced Gandhi, and those who were, in turn, influenced by him. Whilst previous literature tended to focus on Gandhi's political legacy, Weber's book explores the spiritual, social and philosophical resonances of these relationships, and it is with these aspects of the Mahatma's life in mind, that the author selects his central protagonists. These include friends such as Henry Polak and Hermann Kallenbach, who are not as well known as those usually cited, but who left a deep impression nevertheless, and motivated some of Gandhi's major life changes. Conversely, the work of luminaries such as E. F. Schumacher and Gene Sharp reveal the Mahatma's influence in arenas which are not traditionally associated with his thinking. Weber's book offers intriguing insights into the life and thought of one of the most significant figures of the twentieth century."
Introduction to partial differential equations,"Renardy, Michael","Partial differential equations are fundamental to the modeling of natural phenomena.

It is a subject that contains some of the most beautiful and profound results in mathematics, yet many of them are accessible to higher level undergraduates.Elementary Differential Geometry presents the main results in the differential geometry of curves and surfaces while keeping the prerequisites to an absolute minimum. Nothing more than first courses in linear algebra and multivariate calculus are required, and the most direct and straightforward approach is used at all times.

Information and coding theory,"Jones, Gareth A.","As this Preface is being written, the twentieth century is coming to an end. Historians may perhaps come to refer to it as the century of information, just as its predecessor is associated with the process of industrialisation. Successive technological developments such as the telephone, radio, television, computers and the Internet have had profound effects on the way we live. We can see pic tures of the surface of Mars or the early shape of the Universe. The contents of a whole shelf-load of library books can be compressed onto an almost weight less piece of plastic. Billions of people can watch the same football match, or can keep in instant touch with friends around the world without leaving home. In short, massive amounts of information can now be stored, transmitted and processed, with surprising speed, accuracy and economy. Of course, these developments do not happen without some theoretical ba sis, and as is so often the case, much of this is provided by mathematics. Many of the first mathematical advances in this area were made in the mid-twentieth century by engineers, often relying on intuition and experience rather than a deep theoretical knowledge to lead them to their discoveries. Soon the math ematicians, delighted to see new applications for their subject, joined in and developed the engineers' practical examples into wide-ranging theories, com plete with definitions, theorems and proofs."
Introduction to Laplace transforms and Fourier series,"Dyke, P. P. G.","This book has been primarily written for the student of mathematics who is in the second year or the early part of the third year of an undergraduate course. It will also be very useful for students of engineering and the physical sciences for whom Laplace Transforms continue to be an extremely useful tool. The book demands no more than an elementary knowledge of calculus and linear algebra of the type found in many first year mathematics modules for applied subjects. For mathematics majors and specialists, it is not the mathematics that will be challenging but the applications to the real world. The author is in the privileged position of having spent ten or so years outside mathematics in an engineering environment where the Laplace Transform is used in anger to solve real problems, as well as spending rather more years within mathematics where accuracy and logic are of primary importance. This book is written unashamedly from the point of view of the applied mathematician. The Laplace Transform has a rather strange place in mathematics. There is no doubt that it is a topic worthy of study by applied mathematicians who have one eye on the wealth of applications; indeed it is often called Operational Calculus."
Lecture notes on elementary topology and geometry,"Singer, I. M.","At the present time, the average undergraduate mathematics major finds mathematics heavily compartmentalized. After the calculus, he takes a course in analysis and a course in algebra. Depending upon his interests (or those of his department), he takes courses in special topics. Ifhe is exposed to topology, it is usually straightforward point set topology; if he is exposed to geom etry, it is usually classical differential geometry. The exciting revelations that there is some unity in mathematics, that fields overlap, that techniques of one field have applications in another, are denied the undergraduate. He must wait until he is well into graduate work to see interconnections, presumably because earlier he doesn't know enough. These notes are an attempt to break up this compartmentalization, at least in topology-geometry. What the student has learned in algebra and advanced calculus are used to prove some fairly deep results relating geometry, topol ogy, and group theory. (De Rham's theorem, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for surfaces, the functorial relation of fundamental group to covering space, and surfaces of constant curvature as homogeneous spaces are the most note worthy examples.) In the first two chapters the bare essentials of elementary point set topology are set forth with some hint ofthe subject's application to functional analysis."

Polynomials,"Barbeau, E. J.","The book extends the high school curriculum and provides a backdrop for later study in calculus, modern algebra, numerical analysis, and complex variable theory. Exercises introduce many techniques and topics in the theory of equations, such as evolution and factorization of polynomials, solution of equations, interpolation, approximation, and congruences. The theory is not treated formally, but rather illustrated through examples. Over 300 problems drawn from journals, contests, and examinations test understanding, ingenuity, and skill. Each chapter ends with a list of hints; there are answers to many of the exercises and solutions to all of the problems. In addition, 69 ""explorations"" invite the reader to investigate research problems and related topics."
Linear algebra : an introductory approach,"Curtis, Charles W.","Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics that has grown from a care ful study of the problem of solving systems of linear equations. The ideas that developed in this way have become part of the language of much of higher mathematics. They also provide a framework for appli cations of linear algebra to many problems in mathematics, the natural sciences, economics, and computer science. This book is the revised fourth edition of a textbook designed for upper division courses in linear algebra. While it does not presuppose an earlier course, many connections between linear algebra and under graduate analysis are worked into the discussion, making it best suited for students who have completed the calculus sequence. For many students, this may be the first course in which proofs of the main results are presented on an equal footing with methods for solving numerical problems. The concepts needed to understand the proofs are shown to emerge naturally from attempts to solve concrete problems. This connection is illustrated by worked examples in almost every section. Many numerical exercises are included, which use all the ideas, and develop important techniques for problem-solving. There are also theoretical exercises, which provide opportunities for students to discover interesting things for themselves, and to write mathematical explanations in a convincing way. Answers and hints for many of the problems are given in the back. Not all answers are given, however, to encourage students to learn how to check their work."
Wavelet analysis : the scalable structure of information,"Resnikoff, Howard L.","The authors have been beguiled and entranced by mathematics all of their lives, and both believe it is the highest expression of pure thought and an essential component-one might say the quintessence-of nature. How else can one ex plain the remarkable effectiveness of mathematics in describing and predicting the physical world? The projection of the mathematical method onto the subspace of human endeav 1 ors has long been a source of societal progress and commercial technology. The invention of the electronic digital computer (not the mechanical digital computer of Babbage) has made the role of mathematics in civilization even more central by making mathematics active in the operation of products. The writing of this book was intertwined with the development of a start-up company, Aware, Inc. Aware was founded in 1987 by one of the authors (H.L.R.), and the second author (R.O.W.) put his shoulder to the wheel as a consultant soon after."
Field-programmable gate array technology,"Trimberger, Stephen M.","Many different kinds of FPGAs exist, with different programming technologies, different architectures and different software. Field-Programmable Gate Array Technology describes the major FPGA architectures available today, covering the three programming technologies that are in use and the major architectures built on those programming technologies. The reader is introduced to concepts relevant to the entire field of FPGAs using popular devices as examples. Field-Programmable Gate Array Technology includes discussions of FPGA integrated circuit manufacturing, circuit design and logic design. It describes the way logic and interconnect are implemented in various kinds of FPGAs. It covers particular problems with design for FPGAs and future possibilities for new architectures and software. This book compares CAD for FPGAs with CAD for traditional gate arrays. It describes algorithms for placement, routing and optimization of FPGAs. Field-Programmable Gate Array Technology describes all aspects of FPGA design and development. For this reason, it covers a significant amount of material. Each section is clearly explained to readers who are assumed to have general technical expertise in digital design and design tools. Potential developers of FPGAs will benefit primarily from the FPGA architecture and software discussion. Electronics systems designers and ASIC users will find a background to different types of FPGAs and applications of their use."
"Verilog : frequently asked questions : language, applications and extensions","Chonnad, Shivakumar S.","The Verilog Hardware Description Language was first introduced in 1984. Over the 20 year history of Verilog, every Verilog engineer has developed his own personal “bag of tricks” for coding with Verilog. These tricks enable modeling or verifying designs more easily and more accurately. Developing this bag of tricks is often based on years of trial and error. Through experience, engineers learn that one specific coding style works best in some circumstances, while in another situation, a different coding style is best. As with any high-level language, Verilog often provides engineers several ways to accomplish a specific task. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if an engineer first learning Verilog could start with another engineer’s bag of tricks, without having to go through years of trial and error to decide which style is best for which circumstance? That is where this book becomes an invaluable resource. The book presents dozens of Verilog tricks of the trade on how to best use the Verilog HDL for modeling designs at various level of abstraction, and for writing test benches to verify designs. The book not only shows the correct ways of using Verilog for different situations, it also presents alternate styles, and discusses the pros and cons of these styles."

Java messaging,"Bruno, Eric J.","LEARN TO USE JAVA MESSAGING SOFTWARE IN YOUR DISTRIBUTED APPLICATIONS! As software becomes more complex, and the Web is leveraged further, the need for messaging software continues to grow. Virtually all software written today requires at least one form of internal, and even external, communication. Java Messaging explores the various methods of intra-process and inter-process messaging for Java software, such as JavaBean events, JMS, JAX-RPC, JAXM, SOAP, and Web Services. Programmers will learn the basics of these APIs, as well as how, when, and why to use each one, including how to use them in combination, such as combining SOAP with JMS over a WAN. The book begins by walking the reader through simple intra-process communication using JavaBean events. A set of classes is constructed that extend JavaBean events beyond one JVM, transparently using JMS. The messaging paradigms of JMS are explained thoroughly, including in-depth discussions on the theory and mechanics of message queues. Design patterns and helper classes are also explored, which ultimately combine to form a generic messaging framework that helps programmers avoid common pitfalls. This framework, explained throughout the book, provides for the seamless integration of JMS with SOAP Web Services that is required to build distributed applications. Starting from the first chapter, a comprehensive sample application (an online stock trading system) is built using the framework and messaging paradigms discussed in the book. By the end of the book, programmers will not only understand the various messaging paradigms, but they will also understand how to architect complex distributed applications that use them together - with a framework that provides a running start."

"Computer science Logo style. Volume 3, beyond programming","Harvey, Brian","This series is for people--adults and teenagers--who are interested in computer programming because it's fun. The three volumes use the Logo programming language as the vehicle for an exploration of computer science from the perspective of symbolic computation and artificial intelligence. Logo is a dialect of Lisp, a language used in the most advanced research projects in computer science, especially in artificial intelligence. Throughout the series, functional programming techniques (including higher order functions and recursion) are emphasized, but traditional sequential programming is also used when appropriate.In the second edition, the first two volumes have been rearranged so that illustrative case studies appear with the techniques they demonstrate. Volume 1 includes a new chapter about higher order functions, and the recursion chapters have been reorganized for greater clarity. Volume 2 includes a new tutorial chapter about macros, an exclusive capability of Berkeley Logo, and two new projects. Throughout the series, the larger program examples have been rewritten for greater readability by more extensive use of data abstraction.Volume 1 Symbolic Computing, is addressed to a reader who has used computers and wants to learn the ideas behind them. Symbolic computing is the manipulation of words and sentences, in contrast both to the graphics most people associate with Logo and to the numerical computation with which more traditional languages such as Pascal and C++ are most comfortable. This volume is well known for its clear and thorough presentation of recursion, a key idea in computer science that other texts treat as arcane and difficult.The Logo programs in these books and the author's free Berkeley Logo interpreter are available via the Internet or on diskette."

Dams and development : transnational struggles for water and power,"Khagram, Sanjeev","Big dams built for irrigation, power, water supply, and other purposes were among the most potent symbols of economic development for much of the twentieth century. Of late they have become a lightning rod for challenges to this vision of development as something planned by elites with scant regard for environmental and social consequences—especially for the populations that are displaced as their homelands are flooded. In this book, Sanjeev Khagram traces changes in our ideas of what constitutes appropriate development through the shifting transnational dynamics of big dam construction. Khagram tells the story of a growing, but contentious, world society that features novel and increasingly efficacious norms of appropriate behavior in such areas as human rights and environmental protection. The transnational coalitions and networks led by nongovernmental groups that espouse such norms may seem weak in comparison with states, corporations, and such international agencies as the World Bank. Yet they became progressively more effective at altering the policies and practices of these historically more powerful actors and organizations from the 1970s on. Khagram develops these claims in a detailed ethnographic account of the transnational struggles around the Narmada River Valley Dam Projects in central India, a huge complex of thirty large and more than three thousand small dams. He offers further substantiation through a comparative historical analysis of the political economy of big dam projects in India, Brazil, South Africa, and China as well as by examining the changing behavior of international agencies and global companies. The author concludes with a discussion of the World Commission on Dams, an innovative attempt in the late 1990s to generate new norms among conflicting stakeholders."

Brief history of India,"Danielou, Alain","Daniélou's powerful rebuttal to the conventional view of India's history, which calls for a massive reevaluation of the history of humanity • Explores historical occurrences from each major time period starting with the first appearance of man 30,000 years ago • Couples the clarity and perspective of an outsider with the unique and specific knowledge of an insider • By the internationally recognized Hindu scholar and translator of The Complete Kama Sutra (200,000 copies sold) Alain Daniélou approaches the history of India from a new perspective--as a sympathetic outsider, yet one who understands the deepest workings of the culture. Because the history of India covers such a long span of time, rather than try to create an exhaustive chronology of dates and events, Daniélou instead focuses on enduring institutions that remain constant despite the ephemeral historical events that occur. His selections, synthesis, and narration create a thoroughly engaging and readable journey through time, with a level of detail and comprehensiveness that is truly a marvel. Because of the continuity of its civilization, its unique social system, and the tremendous diversity of cultures, races, languages, and religions that exist in its vast territory, India is like a history museum. Its diverse groups maintained their separate identities and never fully supplanted the culture and knowledge of their predecessors. Even today one may encounter in India primitive Stone Age people whose technology has remained at what is considered prehistoric levels. Thus Daniélou's examination of India reveals not only the diversity and historical events and trends of that country, but also the history of all mankind. Through Daniélou's history of India we learn from whence we came, what we have discovered over the years in the fields of science, arts, technology, social structures, religions, and philosophical concepts, and what the future may hold for us."

Design of analog filters,"Van Valkenburg, M. E.","This classic was the first to fill the need for an undergraduate text in analog filters for electrical engineering. Intended for juniors and seniors with a background in introductory circuits, including Laplace transforms, the text focuses on inductorless filters in which the active element is the operational amplifier (op-amp). Passive LCR filters are excluded except as prototypes from which an active equivalent is then found. Students learn the importance of op-amps to analog systems, which Van Valkenburg equates with the significance of the microprocessor to digital systems. Because the book is inteded for undergraduates, sophisticated mathematics has been avoided wherever possible in favor of algebraic derivations. Design topics require at most a hand-held calculator."

Deleuze reconsiders Spinoza, empiricism, and the stoics alongside literature, psychoanalysis, and politics. He returns to the notions of minor literature, deterritorialization, the critical and clinical, and begins a nascent study of cinema. New to this edition is Deleuze's essay ""Pericles and Verdi,"" which reflects on politics and historical materialism in the work of the influential French philosopher François ChÃ¢telet. An enduring record of Deleuze's unique personality and profound contributions to culture and philosophy, Dialogues II is a highly personable account of the evolution of one of the greatest critics and theorists of the twentieth century."

Semantics of science,"Harris, Roy","An introductory linguistics textbook that takes a novel approach: studying linguistic semantics as an exercise in scientific theory construction. This introductory linguistics text takes a novel approach, one that offers educational value to both linguistics majors and nonmajors. Aiming to help students not only grasp the fundamentals of the subject but also engage with broad intellectual issues and develop general intellectual skills, Semantics as Science studies linguistic semantics as an exercise in scientific theory construction. Semantics offers an excellent medium through which to acquaint students with the notion of a formal, axiomatic system—that is, a system that derives results from a precisely articulated set of assumptions according to a precisely articulated set of rules. The book develops semantic theory through the device of axiomatic T-theories, first proposed by Alfred Tarski more than eighty years ago, introducing technical elaboration only when required. It adopts Japanese as its core object of study, allowing students to explore and investigate the real empirical issues arising in the context of non-English structures, a non-English lexicon and non-English meanings. The book is structured as a laboratory science text that poses specific empirical questions, with 25 short units, each of which can be covered in one class session. The layout is engagingly visual, designed to help students understand and retain the material, with lively illustrations, examples, and quotations from famous scholars."

Rational choice and politics : a critical introduction,"Parsons, Stephen","Rational Choice Theory claims to be able to explain how all individuals make not just some of their choices, but all of their choices, all of the time. According to the theory, there is no difference in principle between choosing whether to buy apples rather than bananas or choosing whether to join a political revolution instead of staying at home and watching television. Given these claims to universal applicability, it is perhaps not surprising to find that over the last three or four decades Rational Choice Theory has become increasingly influential as a means of providing explanations in politics. The textbook introduces the premises of Rational Choice Theory and illustrates how this theory can be applied to political studies. The book concludes with an assessment of the usefulness of the model in the light of the problems highlighted. -""Parson's book provides a lucid presentation and a cogent critique of Rational Choice Theory in economics and politics.""

Benefits derived from both the data and visual interfaces to access the data represent a significant return on investment for the public. Integrating geospatial data with semantic and collaborative Web technology multiplies the public benefits and represents the main focus of this book. The user interfaces of geobrowsers are designed for the layperson, giving conv- ient access to all kinds of geographically referenced information. Geobrowsers hide the technical details related to finding, accessing and retrieving such information. The daunting challenge of the Geospatial Web is to seamlessly integrate and display vastly different information modes. Nowadays, it is not enough to simply display a map of some region; additional dynamic information modes need to be displayed and put into context – from weather sensor readings and live aerial video feeds to daily news updates, photo collections and video archives."

Algorithmic aspects of bioinformatics,"Bongartz, Dirk","Advances in bioinformatics and systems biology require improved computational methods for analyzing data, while progress in molecular biology is in turn influencing the development of computer science methods. This book introduces some key problems in bioinformatics, discusses the models used to formally describe these problems, and analyzes the algorithmic approaches used to solve them. After introducing the basics of molecular biology and algorithmics, Part I explains string algorithms and alignments; Part II details the field of physical mapping and DNA sequencing; and Part III examines the application of algorithmics to the analysis of biological data. Exciting application examples include predicting the spatial structure of proteins, and computing haplotypes from genotype data. This book describes topics in detail and presents formal models in a mathematically precise, yet intuitive manner, with many figures and chapter summaries, detailed derivations, and examples. It is well suited as an introduction into the field of bioinformatics, and will benefit students and lecturers in bioinformatics and algorithmics, while also offering practitioners an update on current research topics."
Introduction to percolation theory,"Stauffer, Dietrich","Percolation theory deals with clustering, criticality, diffusion, fractals, phase transitions and disordered systems. It provides a quantitative model for understanding these phenomena, and therefore a theoretical and statistical background to many physical and natural sciences. This book explains the basic theory for the graduate while also reaching into the specialized fields of disordered systems and renormalization groups. Much of the book deals with systems lying close to the critical point phase transition point, where the subject is at its most interesting and sensitive. This text is ideal for those who deal with systems which exhibit critical points and phase transition behavior."

50 years of Yang-Mills theory,"Hooft, Gerardus T.","The Roman Catholic faith has inspired some of the world's greatest creative works and has been a powerful force in history from the Roman Empire to the present. Catholic writers reflect their heritage in their works, and generations of readers have continued to appreciate the Catholic literary tradition. Many works by Catholic writers hold a high place in the literary canon and have exerted a tremendous cultural and political influence. Still others continue to be widely read by contemporary readers and quietly shape modern society. Some works, too, reflect the conflicts of the Catholic Church in the 21st century and capture the struggles of individual Catholics in a secular society. This encyclopedia covers the vast riches of the Catholic literary tradition from its origins to the present day. Included are substantial entries on more than 70 major works from around the world. A special effort has been made to cover women writers and writers of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, whose works reflect the many dimensions of the Catholic experience. The encyclopedia provides entries on such writers and works as St. Augustine's Confessions, Catherine of Siena's Dialogue, Dante's The Divine Comedy, Sandra Cisneros' The House on Mango Street, J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, and Muriel Spark's Memento Mori. Each entry is written by an expert contributor and includes a biography of the writer, a plot summary of a major work, an extended critical discussion, an overview of the work's critical reception, and a selected bibliography. The entries give detailed attention to particular works and explore their relation to Catholic thought. The encyclopedia concludes with a selected, general bibliography."

Modeling decisions : information fusion and aggregation operators,"Torra, Vicenc","Information fusion techniques and aggregation operators produce the most comprehensive, specific datum about an entity using data supplied from different sources, thus enabling us to reduce noise, increase accuracy, summarize and extract information, and make decisions. These techniques are applied in fields such as economics, biology and education, while in computer science they are particularly used in fields such as knowledge-based systems, robotics, and data mining. This book covers the underlying science and application issues related to aggregation operators, focusing on tools used in practical applications that involve numerical information. Starting with detailed introductions to information fusion and integration, measurement and probability theory, fuzzy sets, and functional equations, the authors then cover the following topics in detail: synthesis of judgements, fuzzy measures, weighted means and fuzzy integrals, indices and evaluation methods, model selection, and parameter extraction. The methods are illustrated with representative examples throughout, and there are extensive bibliographies and reading suggestions. The book is intended for graduate students, researchers, and practitioners such as engineers, computer scientists, statisticians and economists who use decision models and aggregation operators. The reader is assumed to have a nonspecialized background in mathematics."
Rethinking engineering education : the CDIO approach,"Crawley, Edward F.","In the past ten years, leaders in engineering industries have identified specific knowledge, skills, and attitudes required of their workforce if they want to be innovative and competitive in a global marketplace. Engineering education programs have kept pace with emerging disciplinary knowledge, research and technologies, but have been less successful in ensuring that their graduates acquire the knowledge, skills, and attitudes desired by industry. Evaluation by accreditation agencies and professional associations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, South Africa, and other countries are moving toward an outcomes-based approach. These groups have specified outcomes for graduating engineers among their evaluative criteria. Their lists of skills overlap with those generated by engineering industries. Our book describes an approach to engineering education that integrates a comprehensive set of personal and interpersonal skills, and process, product, and system building skills with disciplinary knowledge. The education of engineers is set in the context of engineering practice, that is, Conceiving, Designing, Implementing, and Operating (CDIO) through the entire lifecycle of engineering processes, products, and processes. The CDIO model and the topics in the book will be of increasing interest in the next five to ten years. At the start of the CDIO Initiative, four leading engineering programs in the United States and Sweden adopted the CDIO model and collaborated in its development and implementation. In less than six years, the collaboration has grown to include more than twenty programs in nine different countries. This book will be both a description of the development and implementation of the CDIO model, and a guide to engineering programs worldwide who seek to improve their programs."

"Anandamath, or, The sacred brotherhood","Lipner, Julius J.","Winner of the A.K. Ramanujan Prize for Annotated Translation This is a translation of a historically important Bengali novel. Published in 1882, Chatterji's Anandamath helped create the atmosphere and the symbolism for the nationalist movement leading to Indian independence in 1947. It contains the famous hymn Vande Mataram (""I revere the Mother""), which has become India's official National Song. Set in Bengal at the time of the famine of 1770, the novel reflects tensions and oppositions within Indian culture between Hindus and Muslims, ruler and ruled, indigenous people and foreign overlords, jungle and town, Aryan and non-Aryan, celibacy and sexuality. It is both a political and a religious work. By recreating the past of Bengal, Chatterji hoped to create a new present that involved a new interpretation of the past. Julius Lipner not only provides the first complete and satisfactory English translation of this important work, but supplies an extensive Introduction contextualizing the novel and its cultural and political history. Also included are notes offering the Bengali or Sanskrit terms for certain words, as well as explanatory notes for the specialized lay reader or scholar."

Dawn of astronomy : a study of the temple worship and mythology of the ancient Egyptians,"Lockyer, J. Norman","A pioneer in the fields of astrophysics and astro-archeology, J. Norman Lockyer believed that ancient Egyptian monuments were constructed ""in strict relation to the stars."" In this celebrated study, he explores the relationship between astronomy and architecture in the age of the pharaohs. Lockyer addresses one of the many points already extensively investigated by Egyptologists: the chronology of the kings of Egypt. All experts are in accord regarding the identity of the first monarch, but they cannot agree upon the dates of his reign within a thousand years. The author contends that by applying a knowledge of astronomy to the actual site orientation of the region's pyramids and temples, accurate dating can be achieved. In order to accomplish this, Lockyer had to determine the level of the ancient Egyptian ideas of astronomy. Some of his inferences have been invalidated by subsequent scholarship, but many of his other conclusions stand firm and continue to provide sensational leads into contemporary understanding of archaic astronomy."
Integrated Approach to Software Engineering,"Jalote, Pankaj","An introductory course in Software Engineering remains one of the hardest subjects to teach. Much of the difficulty stems from the fact that Software Engineering is a very wide field which includes a wide range of topics. Con sequently, what should be the focus of an introductory course remains a challenge with many possible viewpoints. This third edition of the book approaches the problem from the perspec tive of what skills a student should possess after the introductory course, particularly if it may be the only course on software engineering in the stu dent's program. The goal of this third edition is to impart to the student knowledge and skills that are needed to successfully execute a project of a few person-months by employing proper practices and techniques. In- dently, a vast majority of the projects executed in the industry today are of this scope—executed by a small team over a few months. Another objective of the book is to lay the foundation for the student for advanced studies in Software Engineering. Executing any software project requires skills in two key dimensions— engineering and project management. While engineering deals with issues of architecture, design, coding, testing, etc., project management deals with planning, monitoring, risk management, etc. Consequently, this book fo cuses on these two dimensions, and for key tasks in each, discusses concepts and techniques that can be applied effectively on projects."

New directions in statistical signal processing : from systems to brain,"Haykin, Simon","Leading researchers in signal processing and neural computation present work aimed at promoting the interaction and cross-fertilization between the two fields. Signal processing and neural computation have separately and significantly influenced many disciplines, but the cross-fertilization of the two fields has begun only recently. Research now shows that each has much to teach the other, as we see highly sophisticated kinds of signal processing and elaborate hierachical levels of neural computation performed side by side in the brain. In New Directions in Statistical Signal Processing, leading researchers from both signal processing and neural computation present new work that aims to promote interaction between the two disciplines.The book's 14 chapters, almost evenly divided between signal processing and neural computation, begin with the brain and move on to communication, signal processing, and learning systems. They examine such topics as how computational models help us understand the brain's information processing, how an intelligent machine could solve the ""cocktail party problem"" with ""active audition"" in a noisy environment, graphical and network structure modeling approaches, uncertainty in network communications, the geometric approach to blind signal processing, game-theoretic learning algorithms, and observable operator models (OOMs) as an alternative to hidden Markov models (HMMs)."

India's new middle class : democratic politics in an era of economic reform,"Fernandes, Leela","Today India's middle class numbers more than 250 million people and is growing rapidly. Public reports have focused mainly on the emerging group's consumer potential, while global views of India's new economy range from excitement about market prospects to anxieties over outsourcing of service sector jobs. Yet the consequences of India's economic liberalization and the expansion of the middle class have transformed Indian culture and politics. In India's New Middle Class, Leela Fernandes digs into the implications of this growth and uncovers--in the media, in electoral politics, and on the streets of urban neighborhoods--the complex politics of caste, religion, and gender that shape this rising population. Using rich ethnographic data, she reveals how the middle class represents the political construction of a social group and how it operates as a proponent of economic democratization. Delineating the tension between consumer culture and outsourcing, Fernandes also examines the roots of India's middle class and its employment patterns, including shifting skill sets and labor market restructuring. Through this close look at the country's recent history and reforms, Fernandes develops an original theoretical approach to the nature of politics and class formation in an era of globalization.In this sophisticated analysis of the dynamics of an economic and political group in the making, Fernandes moves beyond reductionist images of India's new middle class to bring to light the group's social complexity and profound influence on politics in India and beyond.Leela Fernandes is associate professor of political science at Rutgers University, New Brunswick."

Development in an ageing world,United Nations. Dept. of Economic and Social Affairs,"Greater longevity is an indicator of human progress in general. Increased life expectancy and lower fertility rates are changing the population structure worldwide in a major way: the proportion of older persons is rapidly increasing, a process known as population ageing. The process is inevitable and is already advanced in developed countries and progressing quite rapidly in developing ones. The 2007 Survey analyses the implications of population ageing for social and economic development around the world, while recognising that it offers both challenges and opportunities. Among the most pressing issues is that arising from the prospect of a smaller labour force having to support an increasingly larger older population. Paralleling increased longevity are the changes in intergenerational relationships that may affect the provision of care and income security for older persons, particularly in developing countries where family transfers play a major role. At the same time, it is also necessary for societies to fully recognise and better harness the productive and social contributions that older persons can make but are in many instances prevented from making. The Survey argues that the challenges are not insurmountable, but that societies everywhere need to put in place the policies required to confront those challenges effectively and to ensure an adequate standard of living for each of their members, while respecting and promoting the contribution and participation of all."

Fifth child,"Lessing, Doris","Doris Lessing's contemporary gothic horror story—centered on the birth of a baby who seems less than human—probes society's unwillingness to recognize its own brutality.Harriet and David Lovatt, parents of four children, have created an idyll of domestic bliss in defiance of the social trends of late 1960s England. While around them crime and unrest surge, the Lovatts are certain that their old-fashioned contentment can protect them from the world outside—until the birth of their fifth baby. Gruesomely goblin-like in appearance, insatiably hungry, abnormally strong and violent, Ben has nothing innocent or infant-like about him. As he grows older and more terrifying, Harriet finds she cannot love him, David cannot bring himself to touch him, and their four older children are afraid of him. Understanding that he will never be accepted anywhere, Harriet and David are torn between their instincts as parents and their shocked reaction to this fierce and unlovable child whose existence shatters their belief in a benign world."

Data mining : a knowledge discovery approach,"Cios, Krzysztof J.","“If you torture the data long enough, Nature will confess,” said 1991 Nobel-winning economist Ronald Coase. The statement is still true. However, achieving this lofty goal is not easy. First, “long enough” may, in practice, be “too long” in many applications and thus unacceptable. Second, to get “confession” from large data sets one needs to use state-of-the-art “torturing” tools. Third, Nature is very stubborn — not yielding easily or unwilling to reveal its secrets at all. Fortunately, while being aware of the above facts, the reader (a data miner) will find several efficient data mining tools described in this excellent book. The book discusses various issues connecting the whole spectrum of approaches, methods, techniques and algorithms falling under the umbrella of data mining. It starts with data understanding and preprocessing, then goes through a set of methods for supervised and unsupervised learning, and concludes with model assessment, data security and privacy issues. It is this specific approach of using the knowledge discovery process that makes this book a rare one indeed, and thus an indispensable addition to many other books on data mining. To be more precise, this is a book on knowledge discovery from data. As for the data sets, the easy-to-make statement is that there is no part of modern human activity left untouched by both the need and the desire to collect data. The consequence of such a state of affairs is obvious."

Semantic web : real-world applications from industry,"Hepp, Martin","The machine-readable representation of products is probably the most important challenge on the road to business applications for the Semantic Web. This will not only help search engines provide more precise product search for human users, but can be expected to support a much higher degree of automation in general, which means basically the delegation of tasks to machines. Current descriptive languages for products and services, like UNSPSC, the German approach eClass, and the eOTD lack both the required coverage of concepts and semantic precision, and it is unclear how they shall be used in Semantic Web applications. One core problem with those traditional classification-based approaches is that in a Semantic Web context, the same document must be machine-readable by a huge number of different partners for a multiplicity of purposes. In other words, the data recipient and the data usage are not predetermined, which makes it difficult to reach consensus about suitable product classes. This paper develops the requirements for product representation in the Semantic Web, evaluates existing alternatives and describes a property-centric product description approach for the Semantic Web, based on the reuse of existing attribute libraries."

"Network Analysis, Architecture, and Design","McCabe, James D.","Traditionally, networking has had little or no basis in analysis or architectural development, with designers relying on technologies they are most familiar with or being influenced by vendors or consultants. However, the landscape of networking has changed so that network services have now become one of the most important factors to the success of many third generation networks. It has become an important feature of the designer's job to define the problems that exist in his network, choose and analyze several optimization parameters during the analysis process, and then prioritize and evaluate these parameters in the architecture and design of the system. Network Analysis, Architecture, and Design, Third Edition, uses a systems methodology approach to teaching these concepts, which views the network (and the environment it impacts) as part of the larger system, looking at interactions and dependencies between the network and its users, applications, and devices. This approach matches the new business climate where customers drive the development of new services and the book discusses how networks can be architected and designed to provide many different types of services to customers. With a number of examples, analogies, instructor tips, and exercises, this book works through the processes of analysis, architecture, and design step by step, giving designers a solid resource for making good design decisions. With examples, guidelines, and general principles McCabe illuminates how a network begins as a concept, is built with addressing protocol, routing, and management, and harmonizes with the interconnected technology around it. Other topics covered in the book are learning to recognize problems in initial design, analyzing optimization parameters, and then prioritizing these parameters and incorporating them into the architecture and design of the system. This is an essential book for any professional that will be designing or working with a network on a routine basis. - Substantially updated design content includes ad hoc networks, GMPLS, IPv6, and mobile networking - Written by an expert in the field that has designed several large-scale networks for government agencies, universities, and corporations - Incorporates real-life ideas and experiences of many expert designers along with case studies and end-of-chapter exercises"

Practical approach to microarray data analysis,"Dubitzky, Werner","In the past several years, DNA microarray technology has attracted tremendous interest in both the scientific community and in industry. With its ability to simultaneously measure the activity and interactions of thousands of genes, this modern technology promises unprecedented new insights into mechanisms of living systems. Currently, the primary applications of microarrays include gene discovery, disease diagnosis and prognosis, drug discovery (pharmacogenomics), and toxicological research (toxicogenomics). Typical scientific tasks addressed by microarray experiments include the identification of coexpressed genes, discovery of sample or gene groups with similar expression patterns, identification of genes whose expression patterns are highly differentiating with respect to a set of discerned biological entities (e.g., tumor types), and the study of gene activity patterns under various stress conditions (e.g., chemical treatment). More recently, the discovery, modeling, and simulation of regulatory gene networks, and the mapping of expression data to metabolic pathways and chromosome locations have been added to the list of scientific tasks that are being tackled by microarray technology. Each scientific task corresponds to one or more so-called data analysis tasks. Different types of scientific questions require different sets of data analytical techniques. Broadly speaking, there are two classes of elementary data analysis tasks, predictive modeling and pattern-detection. Predictive modeling tasks are concerned with learning a classification or estimation function, whereas pattern-detection methods screen the available data for interesting, previously unknown regularities or relationships."

Basics of wireless communications,National Institute of Information Technonlogy,"The use of radio-frequency communication-commonly referred to as wireless communication-is becoming more pervasive as well as more economically and socially important. Technological progress over many decades has enabled the deployment of several successive generations of cellular telephone technology, which is now used by many billions of people worldwide; the near-universal addition of wireless local area networking to personal computers; and a proliferation of actual and proposed uses of wireless communications. The flood of new technologies, applications, and markets has also opened up opportunities for examining and adjusting the policy framework that currently governs the management and use of the spectrum and the institutions involved in it, and models for allocating spectrum and charging for it have come under increasing scrutiny. Yet even as many agree that further change to the policy framework is needed, there is debate about precisely how the overall framework should be changed, what trajectory its evolution should follow, and how dramatic or rapid the change should be. Many groups have opinions, positions, demands, and desires related to these questions-reflecting multiple commercial, social, and political agendas and a mix of technical, economic, and social perspectives. The development of technologies and associated policy and regulatory regimes are often closely coupled, an interplay apparent as early as the 1910s, when spectrum policy emerged in response to the growth of radio communications. As outlined in this report, current and ongoing technological advances suggest the need for a careful reassessment of the assumptions that inform spectrum policy in the United States today. This book seeks to shine a spotlight on 21st-century technology trends and to outline the implications of emerging technologies for spectrum management in ways that the committee hopes will be useful to those setting future spectrum policy."

Handbook of standard English and Indian usage : vocabulary and grammar,"Sethi, J.","The Second Edition of this text continues to build on the three aspects of the language discussed in the previous edition—vocabulary, grammar and idioms. Divided into two parts—Part One: Vocabulary and Part Two: Grammar —the book in Part One deals with ‘Words Often Confused’, ‘Indianisms’, ‘Indian Coinages’, ‘Idioms’, and ‘Archaisms’. Part Two takes up those areas of grammar in which divergences from Standard English are very common—articles, prepositions, tenses, verb patterns, and so on. The emphasis in the Grammar section is not so much on form as on usage. The comments on each divergent item include its Standard English equivalent (and sometimes its origin as well), together with the author’s opinion on whether the item should be retained at least within the country. With such contents and features, the book should prove very valuable to a large cross-section of the educated population—students, English teachers, professionals and businessmen. WHAT’S NEW TO THE EDITION : In Chapter 3, new items on ‘balance’/‘change’ and ‘marketing’/‘shopping’ are added. Additional examples have been provided for dependent questions in Chapter 11. Explanations and comments have been made clear at many places and a few items transferred to places where they seemed to fit in better."
Computational molecular biology : an algorithmic approach,"Pevzner, Pavel A.","In one of the first major texts in the emerging field of computational molecular biology, Pavel Pevzner covers a broad range of algorithmic and combinatorial topics and shows how they are connected to molecular biology and to biotechnology. The book has a substantial ""computational biology without formulas"" component that presents the biological and computational ideas in a relatively simple manner. This makes the material accessible to computer scientists without biological training, as well as to biologists with limited background in computer science. Computational Molecular Biology seriesComputer science and mathematics are transforming molecular biology from an informational to a computational science. Drawing on computational, statistical, experimental, and technological methods, the new discipline of computational molecular biology is dramatically increasing the discovery of new technologies and tools for molecular biology. The new MIT Press Computational Molecular Biology series provides a unique venue for the rapid publication of monographs, textbooks, edited collections, reference works, and lecture notes of the highest quality."

South Asia post 9/11 : searching for stability,"Observer Research Foundation, New Delhi","Radicalism and militancy, political instability, state-terrorism nexus, and growing international interventions make South Asia amongst the most complex security terrains of this age. Counter-Terrorism in South Asia, an outcome of the ORF-Heritage Dialogue on responding to the pervasive phenomenon of terror, is a timely addition to the growing body of literature on terrorism in the region. The two-day dialogue, held in New Delhi in July 2010, involved faculty from Observer Research Foundation, The Heritage Foundation and eminent experts from the United States and India. These chapters, authored by acclaimed security practitioners, foreign policy advisers and researchers, present a contemporary analysis of subjects such as 'Af-Pak' strategy, US-India cooperation, geopolitics of terrorism, insurgency, radicalisation, and nuclear proliferation. Counter-Terrorism in South Asia will be extremely relevant to security practitioners, policy analysts and researchers."

This work brings out the distinctiveness of Indian democratic experience through a contextual political analysis. The Realm of Ideas, the first of the three volumes, explores how modes of inquiry, kinds of knowledge, construction of categories, and historical context shape political analysis and explanation. The scholars argue for methodological pluralism and 'situated knowledge'. They also critique key concepts such as political culture, modernization, civil society, and orientalism and apply them to questions of social change."

This innovative book is a real tour de force from a respected and versatile historian of India.""—Dipesh Chakrabarty, author of Provincializing Europe: Postcolonial Thought and Historical Difference ""As he has done regularly throughout his career, Thomas Metcalf has once again refreshed the study of British imperial history with a bold new perspective. Imperial Connections puts South Asians—soldiers, policemen and labourers—right at the heart of his study.""—C.A. Bayly, Cambridge University, author of The Birth of the Modern World ""This is a distinctly original study which re-centers colonial power in provocative ways. Metcalf asks a simple question—why were Indians so persistently to be found elsewhere in the British empire, and in such significant numbers? Then elegantly offers answers that force us to re-think the operations of imperial power in critical ways. Wide-ranging, elegantly written, and meticulously researched, Metcalf's is an important and a persuasive study.""—Philippa Levine, author of Prostitution, Race and Politics: Policing Venereal Disease in the British Empire, and forthcoming, The British Empire, Sunrise to Sunset"

Writing fast programs : a practical guide for scientists and engineers,"Riley, John","Writing Fast Programs"" provides the basic elements of code optimization and provides strategies for reducing bottlenecks in practical simulation and numerical modeling code. The target audience is scientists and engineers and students in these fields. One pre-publication reviewer called this a much-needed intermediate text to bridge the gap between existing introductory and more advance programming books aimed at scientists. ""Writing Fast Programs"" does not teach basic programming; some programming proficiency is assumed, along with familiarity with the basic programming terminology. Code examples are presented in C, but BASIC (as a convenient pseudo-language) examples are provided for those not familiar with C. In general, the strategies presented are not language specific and should therefore benefit a wide programming audience. For example, similar techniques have been discussed for Java."

Kommos. Volume V : the monumental Minoan buildings at Kommos,"Shaw, Maria C.","Kommos, an ancient site on the island of Crete, is known both for its important Greek sanctuary and for its earlier role as a major Minoan harbor town. This final book in the Princeton series focuses on the results of several decades of excavation at three of the site's monumental public buildings during the Minoan period. Of these, one has the characteristics of a ""Minoan palace,"" a large central court surrounded by wings. Two stoas on either side of the court may have accommodated spectators watching formal events unfold within the court. Other rooms were used for storage. Vessels from the ""palace,"" but also, and mainly, from two buildings that succeeded it in the fourteenth century BC, originate elsewhere in the Aegean and as far as Anatolia, Cyprus, Egypt, Syro-Palestine, and Sardinia, attesting to the site's major role in international trade. One of the later buildings is characterized by six huge rectangular spaces that were likely used to shelter ships during the nonsailing months. This kind of structure, from that period, has never before been found in Crete. Equally unique is the range of imported pottery. The results of the excavation are recorded in detail in chapters commenting on the architecture, on the ""palace's"" painted mural decoration, and on other finds representing a wide range of activities, including the likely production of purple dye, valued for trade amongst the elite. Well-stratified deposits provide a unique opportunity to establish local ceramic developments and to use them to date events that are being considered in terms of sociopolitical and economic perspectives encompassing the Mediterranean and the Near East. This book, which completes a survey of more than six hundred years of history, will prove especially useful to specialists in the Minoan era and to all students of the ancient world."

Embedded multitasking,"Curtis, Keith E.","In an embedded system, firmware is the software that directly interfaces with the microcontroller, controlling the system's function. The major forces driving the embedded firmware development process today are reduced development times, increased complexity, and the need to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. These forces translate into strenuous design requirements for embedded engineers and programmers. Many low-level embedded microcontroller designs have insufficient memory and/or architectural limitations that make the use of a real-time operating system impractical. The techniques presented in this book allow the design of robust multitasking firmware through the use of interleaved state machines. This book presents a complete overview of multitasking terminology and basic concepts. Practical criteria for task selection and state machine design are also discussed.Designing multitasking firmware is arduous, complex and fraught with potential for errors, and there is no one, ""standard way to do it. This book will present a complete and well-organized design approach with examples and sample source code that designers can follow. - Covers every aspect of design from the system level to the component level, including system timing, communicating with the hardware, integration and testing."

Genetically engineered crops and foods : a primer,"Sahai, Suman","Genetically modified foods are foods derived from genetically modified organisms have had specific changes introduced into their DNA by genetic engineering techniques. The main aim of genetically modified crops is to produce a food that is able to survive even if any harmful chemicals or pesticides or herbicides are sprayed. Genetically engineered foods have had their DNA changed using genes from other plants or animals. Scientists take the gene for a desired trait in one plant or animal, and they insert that gene into a cell of another plant or animal. Genetic engineering can be done with plants, animals, or bacteria and other very small organisms. Genetic engineering allows scientists to move desired genes from one plant or animal into another. Genes can also be moved from an animal to a plant or vice versa. Genetic engineering also helps speed up the process of creating new foods with desired traits. Genetically modified material sounds a little bit like science fiction territory, but in reality, much of what we eat on a daily basis is a genetically modified organism. Whether or not these modified foods are actually healthy is still up for debate-and many times, you don't even know that you are buying something genetically modified. The book will be of help to researcher in the field of agriculture, crop improvement, biotechnology etc. It will also be helpful to teachers and students for better understanding of the subject."

Cognitive technology : in search of a humane interface,"Mey, Jacob L.","In this book the editors have gathered a number of contributions by persons who have been working on problems of Cognitive Technology (CT). The present collection initiates explorations of the human mind via the technologies the mind produces. These explorations take as their point of departure the question What happens when humans produce new technologies? Two interdependent perspectives from which such a production can be approached are adopted:• How and why constructs that have their origins in human mental life are embodied in physical environments when people fabricate their habitat, even to the point of those constructs becoming that very habitat• How and why these fabricated habitats affect, and feed back into, human mental life.The aim of the CT research programme is to determine, in general, which technologies, and in particular, which interactive computer-based technologies, are humane with respect to the cognitive development and evolutionary adaptation of their end users. But what does it really mean to be humane in a technological world? To shed light on this central issue other pertinent questions are raised, e.g.• Why are human minds externalised, i.e., what purpose does the process of externalisation serve?• What can we learn about the human mind by studying how it externalises itself? • How does the use of externalised mental constructs (the objects we call 'tools') change people fundamentally?• To what extent does human interaction with technology serve as an amplification of human cognition, and to what extent does it lead to a atrophy of the human mind?The book calls for a reflection on what a tool is. Strong parallels between CT and environmentalism are drawn: both are seen as trends having originated in our need to understand how we manipulate, by means of the tools we have created, our natural habitat consisting of, on the one hand, the cognitive environment which generates thought and determines action, and on the other hand, the physical environment in which thought and action are realised. Both trends endeavour to protect the human habitat from the unwanted or uncontrolled impact of technology, and are ultimately concerned with the ethics and aesthetics of tool design and tool use.Among the topics selected by the contributors to the book, the following themes emerge (the list is not exhaustive): using technology to empower the cognitively impaired; the ethics versus aesthetics of technology; the externalisation of emotive and affective life and its special dialectic ('mirror') effects; creativity enhancement: cognitive space, problem tractability; externalisation of sensory life and mental imagery; the engineering and modelling aspects of externalised life; externalised communication channels and inner dialogue; externalised learning protocols; relevance analysis as a theoretical framework for cognitive technology."

Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay,"Dhamija, Jasleen","Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay (1903-1988) was a remarkable woman of many passions and gifts. She played an important role in the struggle for Indian independence and was similarly a key figure in the international socialist feminist movement. She was India’s ambassador to Asia and Africa, an articulate and unflinching exponent of the idea of decolonization, and one of the earliest advocates of the idea of the global South. A staunch champion of women’s rights, she held views on women’s equality that continue to resonate in our times. Greatly disheartened by the partition of India in 1947, Kamaladevi became involved in the resettlement of refugees and appeared to withdraw from political life. Indeed, the Kamaladevi that most Indians are familiar with is a figure who, above all, revived Indian handicrafts, became the country’s most well-known expert on carpets, puppets and its thousands of craft traditions, and nurtured the greater majority of the country’s national institutions charged with the promotion of dance, drama, art, theatre, music and puppetry. Throughout her life, however, she upheld with all the intellectual vigour and emotional force at her command the idea of the dignity of every human life. Kamaladevi wrote voluminously and her sojourns took her all over the world. She travelled in China during World War II, lectured in Japan, visited Native American pueblos in New Mexico, and forged links with working women and anti-colonial activists in countries across Asia, Africa and Europe. Sadly, most of her writings have long been out of print. The editors of this comprehensive anthology, which is the first serious scholarly attempt to grapple with Kamaladevi’s life and body of work, have sought to represent the wide range of her interests. The extensive selections, comprised largely of journal articles and excerpts from Kamaladevi’s books, are accompanied by a set of original essays by contemporary Indian and American scholars which analyse and contextualize her life and work. This volume should provide the resources for further examination and appreciation of Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay’s unusual gifts and her place in modern Indian and world history. Published by Zubaan."

DNA pioneers and their legacy,"Lagerkvist, Ulf","In this entertaining account of the origins of modern molecular biology, the lives of pioneering scientists in the field of nucleic acid research, and the discovery of DNA, Ulf Lagerkvist speaks not only to scientists but to all students and general readers with an interest in science. The author, whose career in the nucleic acid field began in the late 1940s, recreates historical episodes from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and introduces for a modern audience the scientists whose discoveries revolutionized the field of biology. Knowledge of these pioneers as professionals and as human beings, Lagerkvist believes, may help us see modern problems in a new light and appreciate the greatness of the researchers who contributed to the foundations of molecular biology and biochemistry. Among these scientific pioneers was nineteenth-century biochemist Friedrich Miescher, discoverer of nuclein, the material now known as DNA. The book also explores early research into general problems of the chemistry of biological materials. Lagerkvist vividly describes the research of such influential scientists as Albrecht Kossel, another early leading figure; Emil Fischer, who received the Nobel Prize in 1902 for his work on carbohydrates and purines and was regarded as the foremost chemist of his time; P. A. Levene, known for his discoveries concerning the structure of nucleotides and the way these nucleic acid building blocks are linked to one another; and Oswald T. Avery, often considered the grandfather of molecular genetics."

Modern classical optics,"Brooker, Geoffrey","The book gives accounts of non-quantum optical phenomena and of instruments and technology based on them, at a level suitable for the last two years of an honours degree in physics and for graduates starting out. Topics covered include the conventional (diffraction, coherence, thin films, holography...) but also the less conventional (étendue, Gaussian beams, laser cavities, cd reader, confocal microscope...) which belong in today's university courses, for example, to support laser physics. Even the conventional material has frequently been given a fresh presentation by giving a tidier-than-usual route through a calculation, or finding insightful connections with other parts of physics, or simply avoiding common errors. Problems offer opportunities for checking the reader's basic understanding, or for taking a careful route through reasoning, or for checking orders of magnitude. But most problems contain exploratory and critical material: investigating possible alternative approaches, asking searching questions about fundamentals, or solving apparent paradoxes."

CMOS PLL synthesizers : analysis and design,"Shu, Keliu","Thanks to the advance of semiconductor and communication technology, the wireless communication market has been booming in the last two decades. It evolved from simple pagers to emerging third-generation (3G) cellular phones. In the meanwhile, broadband communication market has also gained a rapid growth. As the market always demands hi- performance and low-cost products, circuit designers are seeking hi- integration communication devices in cheap CMOS technology. The phase-locked loop frequency synthesizer is a critical component in communication devices. It works as a local oscillator for frequency translation and channel selection in wireless transceivers and broadband cable tuners. It also plays an important role as the clock synthesizer for data converters in the analog-and-digital signal interface. This book covers the design and analysis of PLL synthesizers. It includes both fundamentals and a review of the state-of-the-art techniques. The transient analysis of the third-order charge-pump PLL reveals its locking behavior accurately. The behavioral-level simulation of PLL further clarifies its stability limit. Design examples are given to clearly illustrate the design procedure of PLL synthesizers. A complete derivation of reference spurs in the charge-pump PLL is also presented in this book. The in-depth investigation of the digital CA modulator for fractional-N synthesizers provides insightful design guidelines for this important block."

Functional verification of programmable embedded architectures : a top-down approach,"Mishra, Prabhat","It is widely acknowledged that the cost of validation and testing comprises a s- nificant percentage of the overall development costs for electronic systems today, and is expected to escalate sharply in the future. Many studies have shown that up to 70% of the design development time and resources are spent on functional verification. Functional errors manifest themselves very early in the design flow, and unless they are detected up front, they can result in severe consequence- both financially and from a safety viewpoint. Indeed, several recent instances of high-profile functional errors (e. g. , the Pentium FDIV bug) have resulted in - creased attention paid to verifying the functional correctness of designs. Recent efforts have proposed augmenting the traditional RTL simulation-based validation methodology with formal techniques in an attempt to uncover hard-to-find c- ner cases, with the goal of trying to reach RTL functional verification closure. However, what is often not highlighted is the fact that in spite of the tremendous time and effort put into such efforts at the RTL and lower levels of abstraction, the complexity of contemporary embedded systems makes it difficult to guarantee functional correctness at the system level under all possible operational scenarios. The problem is exacerbated in current System-on-Chip (SOC) design meth- ologies that employ Intellectual Property (IP) blocks composed of processor cores, coprocessors, and memory subsystems. Functional verification becomes one of the major bottlenecks in the design of such systems."
Game theory : a very short introduction,"Binmore, K. G.","Games are everywhere: Drivers manoeuvring in heavy traffic are playing a driving game. Bargain hunters bidding on eBay are playing an auctioning game. A firm negotiating next year's wage is playing a bargaining game. The opposing candidates in an election are playing a political game. The supermarket's price for corn flakes is decided by playing an economic game. Game theory is about how to play such games in a rational way. Even when the players have not thought everything out in advance, game theory often works for the same reason that mindless animals sometimes end up behaving very cleverly: evolutionary forces eliminate irrational play because it is unfit. Game theory has seen spectacular successes in evolutionary biology and economics, and is beginning to revolutionize other disciplines from psychology to political science. This Very Short Introduction introduces the fascinating world of game theory, showing how it can be understood without mathematical equations, and revealing that everything from how to play poker optimally to the sex ratio among bees can be understood by anyone willing to think seriously about the problem. ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly.

Great Indian way : a life of Mahatma Gandhi,"Rao, Raja","With a new introduction by Makarand R. Paranjape The life of Mahatma Gandhi is the story of a legend. In Mahatma Gandhi: The Great Indian Way, Raja Rao upends the genre of the literary biography with inventive non-linear chronology, through dialogue and anecdote, situating the physical within the metaphysical, and with a text that is both retrospective and contemporary at the same time. By mapping genealogies and distilling them, Rao focuses on Gandhi's years in South Africa, the birth of non-violent resistance, and then moves into the epic freedom struggle in India, which brought Gandhi to worldwide renown in his own lifetime. With an emphasis on the idea of dharma as a framework for Gandhism, both in South Africa and India, this is the story of the man as much as the Mahatma."

Mathematical sorcery : revealing the secrets of numbers,"Clawson, Calvin C.","There are two kinds of people: those who can do mathematics, and then there's the rest of us. Math is boring. Females have no facility for mathematics (and really don't need it, anyway).For many people who do not like math, these myths ring true. Calvin Clawson, the celebrated author of Mathematical Mysteries , has a unique talent for opening the door for the uninitiated to the splendors of mathematics. A writer in love with his subject, Clawson offers readers the perfect antidote to the phobias and misconceptions surrounding mathematics in Mathmatical Sorcery . Contending that the power and beauty of mathematics are gifts in which we all can partake, he shows that the field of mathematics holds a bounty of wonder that can be reaped by any one of us in the hopes of discovering new truths. In this captivating quest for pure knowledge, Clawson takes us on a journey to the amazing discoveries of our ancient ancestors. He divulges the wisdom of the Ancient Greeks, Sumerians, Babylonians, and Egyptians, whose stunning revelations still have deep meaning to us today. The secrets of the constellations, the enigma of the golden mean, and the brilliance of a proof are just some of the breakthroughs he explores with unbridled delight. Enabling us to appreciate the achievements of Newton and other intellectual giants, Clawson inspires us through his eloquence and zeal to actually do mathematics, urging us to leap to the next level. He helps us intuitively comprehend and follow the very building blocks that too long have been a mystery to most of us, including infinity, functions, and the limit. As he elegantly states: ""Mathematics is pursued not only for the sheer joy of the pursuit, as with the Ancient Greeks, but for the truths it reveals about our universe."" Through Mathmatical Sorcery , we taste the fruit of knowledge that has eluded us until now."

Founders at work : stories of startups' early days,"Livingston, Jessica","Founders at Work: Stories of Startups' Early Days is a collection of interviews with founders of famous technology companies about what happened in the very earliest days. These people are celebrities now. What was it like when they were just a couple friends with an idea? Founders like Steve Wozniak (Apple), Caterina Fake (Flickr), Mitch Kapor (Lotus), Max Levchin (PayPal), and Sabeer Bhatia (Hotmail) tell you in their own words about their surprising and often very funny discoveries as they learned how to build a company. Where did they get the ideas that made them rich? How did they convince investors to back them? What went wrong, and how did they recover? Nearly all technical people have thought of one day starting or working for a startup. For them, this book is the closest you can come to being a fly on the wall at a successful startup, to learn how it's done. But ultimately these interviews are required reading for anyone who wants to understand business, because startups are business reduced to its essence. The reason their founders become rich is that startups do what businesses do—create value—more intensively than almost any other part of the economy. How? What are the secrets that make successful startups so insanely productive? Read this book, and let the founders themselves tell you."

These disciplines are designed to code, transmit, detect, decode, and process signals and related information, and can be broadly addressed as information science and technology. In the sophisticated society in which we live and operate, this science is diffused transversely and plays a major role in almost every human activity. Information science and technology is the basis of a powerful industry that does not suffer the shortcomings of more traditional human enterprises. Information is a renewable source and its control and processing rely on software codes, which are a creation of the mind, and on related hardware, incredibly sophisticated but made out of simple, abundant materials. The rate of change and transformation of this industry is the highest mankind has ever experienced, and it requires not only the replacement of technologies but also a continuous updating of expertise to keep up with the rapid transformation. There is no doubt that this calls for a change in university training, to avoid students graduating at an already obsolete level."

The mathematics of networks form the basis of many fascinating puzzles and problems, from tic-tac-toe and circular sudoku to the 'Chinese Postman Problem' (can he deliver all his letters without traversing the same street twice?). Peter Higgins shows how such puzzles as well as many real-world phenomena are underpinned by the same deep mathematical structure. Understanding mathematical networks can give us remarkable new insights into them all."

Pragmatic circuits : signals and filters,"Eccles, William J.","Pragmatic Circuits: Signals and Filters is built around the processing of signals. Topics include spectra, a short introduction to the Fourier series, design of filters, and the properties of the Fourier transform. The focus is on signals rather than power. But the treatment is still pragmatic. For example, the author accepts the work of Butterworth and uses his results to design filters in a fairly methodical fashion. This third of three volumes finishes with a look at spectra by showing how to get a spectrum even if a signal is not periodic. The Fourier transform provides a way of dealing with such non-periodic signals. The two other volumes in the Pragmatic Circuits series include titles on DC and Time Domain and Frequency Domain. These short lecture books will be of use to students at any level of electrical engineering and for practicing engineers, or scientists, in any field looking for a practical and applied introduction to circuits and signals.

Quantum computing for computer architects,"Metodi, Tzvetan S.","Quantum computation may seem to be a topic for science fiction, but small quantum computers have existed for several years and larger machines are on the drawing table. These efforts have been fueled by a tantalizing property: while conventional computers employ a binary representation that allows computational power to scale linearly with resources at best, quantum computations employ quantum phenomena that can interact to allow computational power that is exponential in the number of quantum bits in the system. Quantum devices rely on the ability to control and manipulate binary data stored in the phase information of quantum wave functions that describe the electronic states of individual atoms or the polarization states of photons. While existing quantum technologies are in their infancy, we shall see that it is not too early to consider scalability and reliability. In fact, such considerations are a critical link in the development chain of viable device technologies capable of orchestrating reliable control of tens of millions quantum bits in a large-scale system. The goal of this lecture is to provide architectural abstractions common to potential technologies and explore the systems-level challenges in achieving scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computation."
Theory of timed I/O automata,"Kaynar, Dilsun K.","This monograph presents the Timed Input/Output Automaton (TIOA) modeling framework, a basic mathematical framework to support description and analysis of timed (computing) systems. Timed systems are systems in which desirable correctness or performance properties of the system depend on the timing of events, not just on the order of their occurrence. Timed systems are employed in a wide range of domains including communications, embedded systems, real-time operating systems, and automated control. Many applications involving timed systems have strong safety, reliability, and predictability requirements, which make it important to have methods for systematic design of systems and rigorous analysis of timing-dependent behavior. The TIOA framework also supports description and analysis of timed distributed algorithms -- distributed algorithms whose correctness and performance depend on the relative speeds of processors, accuracy of local clocks, or communication delay bounds. Such algorithms arise, for example, in traditional and wireless communications, networks of mobile devices, and shared-memory multiprocessors. The need to prove rigorous theoretical results about timed distributed algorithms makes it important to have a suitable mathematical foundation. An important feature of the TIOA framework is its support for decomposing timed system descriptions. In particular, the framework includes a notion of external behavior for a timed I/O automaton, which captures its discrete interactions with its environment. The framework also defines what it means for one TIOA to implement another, based on an inclusion relationship between their external behavior sets, and defines notions of simulations, which provide sufficient conditions for demonstrating implementation relationships. The framework includes a composition operation for TIOAs, which respects external behavior, and a notion of receptiveness, which implies that a TIOA does not block the passage of time. The TIOA framework also defines the notion of a property and what it means for a property to be a safety or a liveness property. It includes results that capture common proof methods for showing that automata satisfy properties.

Indian philosophy,"Dixit, K. K.","The present volume appears to be the first general introduction, for English-reading students, to that which, in Indian tradition, corresponds to 'philosophy' in British and probably in most other English-speaking universities. It shows how Indian philosophers have posed such questioins as whether we can be sure we 'know' anything, whether words 'mean' anything, whether it is possible to generalise from observed regularities in nature and whether there is anything in nature, or in 'reality', corresponding to our concept of a 'class'. It traces the sustained and rigorous analysis of such philosophical problems through many centuries, indicating in outline the interrelationships of ideas and 'schools' and development of the theory of knowledge, formal logic and other analytical investigations. The closely related development of science in India is also indicated. This does not imply that Indian philosophy is the same as 'Western' philosophy or part of it, which would make it redundant and uninteresting. It is interesting in that it discusses similar philosophical problems in different ways, as philosophers elsewhere have. But there is the problem of translation, obvious in most books on Indian tradition, especially if we compare any two of them. This Course is based only on original Sanskrit, Pali and Prakrit sources translated by the author."

Sallekhana is not suicide,"Tukol, T. K.","Jainism regards life to be eternal. Recognizing that the soul can never die, but merely takes a new body, a careful tradition welcoming death through intentional fasting developed more than two thousand years ago. A legal challenge Rajasthan was put forward in 2013, suggesting that this practice is harmful and coercive and targets women in particular. For a short while SallekhanÀ, which means the “thinning of existence,” was declared illegal. In response to this controversy, three conferences were convened by the International School for Jain Studies to explore the legal, religious, and medical aspects of this practice. Experts discussed the long history of the practice, attested to in epigraphs throughout India; the ways in which fasting to death has become an acceptable practice in the Western world; and contemporary instances of its observance in India. This volume presents an interdisciplinary approach to thinking about the end of life, from biomedical, historical, religious, and legal perspectives."

PSpice for analog communications engineering,"Tobin, Paul","In PSpice for Analog Communications Engineering we simulate the difficult principles of analog modulation using the superb free simulation software Cadence Orcad PSpice V10.5. While use is made of analog behavioral model parts (ABM), we use actual circuitry in most of the simulation circuits. For example, we use the 4-quadrant multiplier IC AD633 as a modulator and import real speech as the modulating source and look at the trapezoidal method for measuring the modulation index. Modulation is the process of relocating signals to different parts of the radio frequency spectrum by modifying certain parameters of the carrier in accordance with the modulating/information signals. In amplitude modulation, the modulating source changes the carrier amplitude, but in frequency modulation it causes the carrier frequency to change (and in phase modulation it's the carrier phase). The digital equivalent of these modulation techniques are examined in PSpice for Digital communications Engineering where we examine QAM, FSK, PSK and variants. We examine a range of oscillators and plot Nyquist diagrams showing themarginal stability of these systems. The superhetrodyne principle, the backbone of modern receivers is simulated using discrete components followed by simulating complete AM and FM receivers. In this exercise we examine the problems ofmatching individual stages and the use of double-tuned RF circuits to accommodate the large FM signal bandwidth."

Signal processing of random physiological signals,"Lessard, Charles S.","This lecture book is intended to be an accessible and comprehensive introduction to random signal processing with an emphasis on the real-world applications of biosignals. Although the material has been written and developed primarily for advanced undergraduate biomedical engineering students it will also be of interest to engineers and interested biomedical professionals of any discipline seeking an introduction to the field. Within education, most biomedical engineering programs are aimed to provide the knowledge required of a graduate student while undergraduate programs are geared toward designing circuits and of evaluating only the cardiac signals. Very few programs teach the processes with which to evaluate brainwave, sleep, respiratory sounds, heart valve sounds, electromyograms, electro-oculograms, or random signals acquired from the body. The primary goal of this lecture book is to help the reader understand the time and frequency domain processes which may be used and to evaluate random physiological signals. A secondary goal is to learn the evaluation of actual mammalian data without spending most the time writing software programs. This publication utilizes “DADiSP”, a digital signal processing software, from the DSP Development Corporation."

Theory of linear prediction,"Vaidyanathan, P. P.","Linear prediction theory has had a profound impact in the field of digital signal processing. Although the theory dates back to the early 1940s, its influence can still be seen in applications today. The theory is based on very elegant mathematics and leads to many beautiful insights into statistical signal processing. Although prediction is only a part of the more general topics of linear estimation, filtering, and smoothing, this book focuses on linear prediction. This has enabled detailed discussion of a number of issues that are normally not found in texts. For example, the theory of vector linear prediction is explained in considerable detail and so is the theory of line spectral processes. This focus and its small size make the book different from many excellent texts which cover the topic, including a few that are actually dedicated to linear prediction. There are several examples and computer-based demonstrations of the theory. Applications are mentioned wherever appropriate, but the focus is not on the detailed development of these applications. The writing style is meant to be suitable for self-study as well as for classroom use at the senior and first-year graduate levels. The text is self-contained for readers with introductory exposure to signal processing, random processes, and the theory of matrices, and a historical perspective and detailed outline are given in the first chapter. Table of Contents: Introduction / The Optimal Linear Prediction Problem / Levinson's Recursion / Lattice Structures for Linear Prediction / Autoregressive Modeling / Prediction Error Bound and Spectral Flatness / Line Spectral Processes / Linear Prediction Theory for Vector Processes / Appendix A: Linear Estimation of Random Variables / B: Proof of a Property of Autocorrelations / C: Stability of the Inverse Filter / Recursion Satisfied by AR Autocorrelations"

The emphasis in this book is on the time-domain TLM. Physical concepts are emphasized here before embarking onto mathematical development in order to provide simple, straightforward suggestions for the development of models that can then be readily programmed for further computations. Sections with strong mathematical flavors have been included where there are clear methodological advantages forming the basis for developing practical modeling tools. The book can be read at different depths depending on the background of the reader, and can be consulted as and when the need arises."

Art history : a very short introduction,"Arnold, Dana","Art history encompasses the study of the history and development of painting, sculpture and the other visual arts. In this Very Short Introduction, Dana Arnold presents an introduction to the issues, debates, and artefacts that make up art history. Beginning with a consideration of what art history is, she explains what makes the subject distinctive from other fields of study, and also explores the emergence of social histories of art (such as Feminist Art History and Queer Art History). Using a wide range of images, she goes on to explore key aspects of the discipline including how we write, present, read, and look at art, and the impact this has on our understanding of art history. This second edition includes a new chapter on global art histories, considering how the traditional emphasis on periods and styles in art originated in western art and can obscure other critical approaches and artwork from non-western cultures. Arnold also discusses the relationship between art and history, and the ways in which art can tell a different history from the one narrated by texts.

Earth : a very short introduction,"Redfern, Martin","For generations, the ground beneath the feet of our ancestors seemed solid and unchanging. Around 30 years ago, two things happened that were to revolutionize the understanding of our home planet. First, geologists realized that the continents themselves were drifting across the surface of the globe and that oceans were being created and destroyed. Secondly, pictures of the entire planet were returned from space. As the astronomer Fred Hoyle had predicted, this 'let loose an idea as powerful as any in history'. Suddenly, the Earth began to be viewed as a single entity; a dynamic, interacting whole, controlled by complex processes we scarcely understood. It began to seem less solid. As one astronaut put it, 'a blue jewel on black velvet; small, fragile and touchingly alone'. Geologists at last were able to see the whole as well as the detail; the wood as well as the trees. This book brings their account up to date with the latest understanding of the processes that govern our planet.

History of astronomy : a very short introduction,"Hoskin, Michael A.","Astronomy, perhaps the first of the sciences, was already well developed by the time of Christ. Seventeen centuries later, after Newton showed that the movements of the planets could be explained in terms of gravitation, it became the paradigm for the mathematical sciences. In the nineteenth century the analysis of star-light allowed astrophysicists to determine both the chemical composition and the radial velocities of celestial bodies, while the development of photography enabled distant objects invisible to the human eye, to be studied and measured in comfort. Technical developments during and since the Second World War have greatly enlarged the scope of the science by permitting the study of radiation. This is a fascinating introduction to the history of Western astronomy, from prehistoric times to the origins of astrophysics in the mid-nineteenth century. Historical records are first found in Babylon and Egypt, and after two millennia the arithmetical astronomy of the Babylonians merged with the Greek geometrical approach to culminate in the Almagest of Ptolemy. This legacy was transmitted to the Latin West via Islam, and led to Copernicus's claim that the Earth is in motion. In justifying this Kepler converted astronomy into a branch of dynamics, leading to Newton's universal law of gravity. The book concludes with eighteenth- and nineteenth-century applications of Newton's law, and the first explorations of the universe of stars.

History of time : a very short introduction,"Holford-Strevens, Leofranc","Leofranc Holford-Strevens explores time measurement and the organisation of time into hours, days, months and years using a range of fascinating examples from Ancient Rome and Julius Caesar's Leap Year, to the 1920s' project for a fixed Easter."
Journalism : a very short introduction,"Hargreaves, Ian","Journalism entered the twenty-first century caught in a paradox. The world had more journalism, across a wider range of media, than at any time since the birth of the western free press in the eighteenth century. Western journalists had found themselves under a cloud of suspicion: from politicians, philosophers, the general public, anti-globalization radicals, religious groups, and even from fellow journalists. Critics argued that the news industry had lost its moral bearings, focusing on high investment returns rather than reporting and analysing the political, economic, and social issues of the day. Journalism has a central and profound impact on our worldview; we find it everywhere from newspapers and television, to radio and the Internet. In the new edition of this thought-provoking and provocative Very Short Introduction, Ian Hargreaves examines the world of contemporary journalism. By looking not only at what journalism has been in the past, but also what it is becoming in the digital age, he examines the big issues relating to reportage, warfare, celebrity culture, privacy, and technology worldwide.

Modern art : a very short introduction,"Cottington, David","As public interest in modern art continues to grow, as witnessed by the spectacular success of Tate Modern and the Bilbao Guggenheim, there is a real need for a book that will engage general readers, offering them not only information and ideas about modern art, but also explaining its contemporary relevance and history. This book achieves all this and focuses on interrogating the idea of 'modern' art by asking such questions as: What has made a work of art qualify as modern (or fail to)? How has this selection been made? What is the relationship between modern and contemporary art? Is 'postmodernist' art no longer modern, or just no longer modernist - in either case, why, and what does this claim mean, both for art and the idea of 'the modern'? Cottington examines many key aspects of this subject, including the issue of controversy in modern art, from Manet's Dejeuner sur L'Herbe (1863) to Picasso's Les Demoiselles, and Tracey Emin's Bed, (1999); and the role of the dealer from the main Cubist art dealer Kahnweiler to Charles Saatchi.

Nationalism : a very short introduction,"Grosby, Steven Elliott","Throughout history, humanity has borne witness to the political and moral challenges that arise when people place national identity above allegiance to geo-political states or international communities. This book discusses the concept of nations and nationalism from social, philosophical, geological, theological and anthropological perspectives. It examines the subject through conflicts past and present, including recent conflicts in the Balkans and the Middle East, rather than exclusively focusing on theory. Above all, this fascinating and comprehensive work clearly shows how feelings of nationalism are an inescapable part of being human."

Plato : a very short introduction,"Annas, Julia","This lively and accessible introduction to Plato focuses on the philosophy and argument of his writings, drawing the reader into Plato's way of doing philosophy, and the general themes of his thinking. This is not a book to leave the reader standing in the outer court of introduction and background information, but leads directly into Plato's argument. It looks at Plato as a thinker grappling with philosophical problems in a variety of ways, rather than a philosopher with a fully worked-out system. It includes a brief account of Plato's life and the various interpretations that have been drawn from the sparse remains of information. It stresses the importance of the founding of the Academy and the conception of philosophy as a subject. Julia Annas discusses Plato's style of writing: his use of the dialogue form, his use of what we today call fiction, and his philosophical transformation of myths. She also looks at his discussions of love and philosophy, his attitude to women, and to homosexual love, explores Plato's claim that virtue is sufficient for happiness, and touches on his arguments for the immortality of the soul and his ideas about the nature of the universe.

Political philosophy : a very short introduction,"Miller, David","This book introduces readers to the concepts of political philosophy. It starts by explaining why the subject is important and how it tackles basic ethical questions such as 'how should we live together in society?' It looks at political authority, the reasons why we need politics at all, the limitations of politics, and whether there are areas of life that shouldn't be governed by politics. It explores the connections between political authority and justice, a constant theme in political philosophy, and the ways in which social justice can be used to regulate rather than destroy a market economy. David Miller discusses why nations are the natural units of government and whether the rise of multiculturalism and transnational co-operation will change this: will we ever see the formation of a world government?

Prehistory : a very short introduction,"Gosden, Chris","Prehistory covers the period of some 4 million years before the start of written history, when our earliest ancestors, the Australopithecines, existed in Africa. But this is relatively recent compared to whole history of the earth of some 4.5 billion years. A key aspect of prehistory is that it provides a sense of scale, throwing recent ways of life into perspective. Humans and their ancestors lived in many different ways and the cultural variety we see now is just a tiny fraction of that which has existed over millions of years. Humans are part of the broader evolution of landscapes and communities of plants and animals, but Homo sapiens is also the only species to have made a real impact on planetary systems. To understand such an impact, we need a grasp of our longest term development and ways of life. In this new edition of his Very Short Introduction, Chris Gosden invites us to think seriously about who we are by considering who we have been. As he explains, many new discoveries have been made in archaeology over the last ten years, and a new framework for prehistory is emerging. A greater understanding of Chinese and central Asian prehistory has thrown Eurasian prehistory in quite a different light, with flows of the influence of culture over large areas now evident. This has eaten away at the traditional view of human progress around the invention of agriculture, the development of cities and (much later) the industrial revolution, and given us new geographies to think about. Chris Gosden explores the new landscape of our prehistory, and considers the way the different geographical locations weave together.

World Trade Organization : a very short introduction,"Narlikar, Amrita","The World Trade Organization (WTO) is scarcely ten years old, but even in these early years of its existence it has generated debate, controversy and even outrage. Rulings on beef hormones and tuna-dolphin cases provide graphic examples of how the organization regulates and intrudes into areas of individual consumer choice, ethical preferences, and cultural habits. This deep and far-ranging impact of the WTO on peoples' everyday lives means that it is not just an institution of interest to economists, but to everyone, a fact that was perhaps most graphically illustrated in the popular demonstrations at the 1999 Seattle Ministerial. Such protests have become a regular feature associated with most high-level meetings of the WTO. This VSI will provide a timely and carefully considered explanation of what the WTO is, what it does, and how it goes about executing its tasks. A clear understanding of the mandate, structure and functioning of the WTO is essential to appreciate the controversy behind the organization, and how far it deserves the reputation that it has come to acquire.

Rational points on elliptic curves,"Silverman, Joseph H.","The theory of elliptic curves involves a pleasing blend of algebra, geometry, analysis, and number theory. This volume stresses this interplay as it develops the basic theory, thereby providing an opportunity for advanced undergraduates to appreciate the unity of modern mathematics. At the same time, every effort has been made to use only methods and results commonly included in the undergraduate curriculum. This accessibility, the informal writing style, and a wealth of exercises make Rational Points on Elliptic Curves an ideal introduction for students at all levels who are interested in learning about Diophantine equations and arithmetic geometry. Most concretely, an elliptic curve is the set of zeroes of a cubic polynomial in two variables. If the polynomial has rational coefficients, then one can ask for a description of those zeroes whose coordinates are either integers or rational numbers. It is this number theoretic question that is the main subject of Rational Points on Elliptic Curves. Topics covered include the geometry and group structure of elliptic curves, the Nagell–Lutz theorem describing points of finite order, the Mordell–Weil theorem on the finite generation of the group of rational points, the Thue–Siegel theorem on the finiteness of the set of integer points, theorems on counting points with coordinates in finite fields, Lenstra's elliptic curve factorization algorithm, and a discussion of complex multiplication and the Galois representations associated to torsion points. Additional topics new to the second edition include an introduction to elliptic curve cryptography and a brief discussion of the stunning proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Wiles et al. via the use of elliptic curves."

Attracting talented students to maths and science,National Knowledge Commission,"Gifted education has come to be regarded as a key national programme in many coutnries, and gifted education in science disciplines is now being recognised to be of major importance for economic and technological development. Despite these initiatives and developments internationally, there are very few discussions on gifted education in science drawing upon practices and experiences in different national contexts. In support of an international dialogue between researchers and practitioners, often working within isolated traditions, this book offers information on key influential approaches to science education for gifted learners and surveys current policy and practice from a diverse range of educational contexts. The volume offers an informative introduction for those new to studying gifted science education, as well as supporting the development of the field by offering examples of critical thinking about key issues, and accounts of the influences at work within education systems and the practical complexities of providing science education for the gifted. The contributions draw upon a variety of research approaches to offer insights into the constraints and affordancxes of working within particular policy contexts, and the strengths and challenges inherent in different approaches to practice. Chapters include: Teaching science to the gifted in English state schools: locating a compromised 'gifted & talented' policy within its systemic context Models of education for science talented adolescents in the United States: Past, present, and likely future trends Navigating the shifting terrain between policy and practice for gifted learners in Tanzania Science education for female indigenous gifted students in the Mexican context Gifted Science Education in the Context of Japanese Standardization This book will appeal to scholars, practitioners and policy makers who are in the field of gifted science education."

Web 2.0 : the business model,"Lytras, Miltiadis D.","While the web itself is about twenty years old, businesses are still impleme- ing the technology into the fabric of the business model. The background section will focus on defining the building blocks for the framework including defining the basic components of Web 1. 0 which focused on the presence and business transaction. The Web 2. 0 section will focus on defining the basic building blocks of customer interactions, while the final section will focus on a review the wine industry. 2. 1 Web 1. 0: Presence and Electronic Commerce The term Web 1. 0 emerged from the research around the development of Web 2. 0. Prior to this, researchers commonly referred to Web 1. 0 as Electronic C- merce or E-Business. Where as, web 1. 0 focused on a read only web interface, Web 2. 0 focuses on a read-write interface where value emerges from the contri- tion of a large volume of users. The Internet initially focused on the command and control of the information itself. Information was controlled by a relative small number of resources but distributed to a large number which spawned the massive growth of the web itself. Like television before it, the web allowed for the broadcasting of information to a large number of users. Initial web sites were built simply to communicate presence or provide information on the business - self. This component includes information like marketing materials, investor re- tions, employment opportunities, and product information."

Statistical methods in bioinformatics : an introduction,"Grant, Gregory R.","Advances in computers and biotechnology have had a profound impact on biomedical research, and as a result complex data sets can now be generated to address extremely complex biological questions. Correspondingly, advances in the statistical methods necessary to analyze such data are following closely behind the advances in data generation methods. The statistical methods required by bioinformatics present many new and difficult problems for the research community. This book provides an introduction to some of these new methods. The main biological topics treated include sequence analysis, BLAST, microarray analysis, gene finding, and the analysis of evolutionary processes. The main statistical techniques covered include hypothesis testing and estimation, Poisson processes, Markov models and Hidden Markov models, and multiple testing methods. The second edition features new chapters on microarray analysis and on statistical inference, including a discussion of ANOVA, and discussions of the statistical theory of motifs and methods based on the hypergeometric distribution. Much material has been clarified and reorganized. The book is written so as to appeal to biologists and computer scientists who wish to know more about the statistical methods of the field, as well as to trained statisticians who wish to become involved with bioinformatics. The earlier chapters introduce the concepts of probability and statistics at an elementary level, but with an emphasis on material relevant to later chapters and often not covered in standard introductory texts. Later chapters should be immediately accessible to the trained statistician. Sufficient mathematical background consists of introductory courses in calculus and linear algebra. The basic biological concepts that are used are explained, or can be understood from the context, and standard mathematical concepts are summarized in an Appendix. Problems are provided at the end of each chapter allowing the reader to develop aspects of the theory outlined in the main text. Warren J. Ewens holds the Christopher H.

"Soft computing and intelligent systems design : theory, tools and applications","Karray, Fakhreddine O.","Traditional artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are based around mathematical techniques of symbolic logic, with programming in languages such as Prolog and LISP invented in the 1960s. These are referred to as ""crisp"" techniques by the soft computing community. The new wave of AI methods seeks inspiration from the world of biology, and is being used to create numerous real-world intelligent systems with the aid of soft computing tools. These new methods are being increasingly taught at the upper end of the curriculum, sometimes as an adjunct to traditional AI courses, and sometimes as a replacement for them. Where a more radical approach is taken and the course is being taught at an introductory level, we have recently published Negnevitsky's book. Karray and Silva will be suitable for the majority of courses which will be found at an advanced level. Karray and de Silva cover the problem of control and intelligent systems design using soft-computing techniques in an integrated manner. They present both theory and applications, including industrial applications, and the book contains numerous worked examples, problems and case studies. Covering the state-of-the-art in soft-computing techniques, the book gives the reader sufficient knowledge to tackle a wide range of complex systems for which traditional techniques are inadequate."

Zero has pitted East against West and faith against reason, and its intransigence persists in the dark core of a black hole and the brilliant flash of the Big Bang. Today, zero lies at the heart of one of the biggest scientific controversies of all time: the quest for a theory of everything. Within the concept of zero lies a philosophical and scientific history of humanity. Charles Seife's elegant and witty account takes us from Aristotle to superstring theory by way of Egyptian geometry, Kabbalism, Einstein, the Chandrasekhar limit and Stephen Hawking. Covering centuries of thought, it is a concise tour of a world of ideas, bound up in the simple notion of nothing."

Quantum computation and quantum communication : theory and experiments,"Pavicic, Mladen","The attraction of quantum computation and quantum communica tion theory and experiments hes in the fact that we engineer both them themselves and the quantum systems they treat. This approach has turned out to be very resiUent. Driven by the final goal of calculating exponentially faster and communicating infinitely more securely than we do today, as soon as we encounter a limitation in either a theory or experiment, a new idea around the no-go emerges. As soon as the decoherence ""demon"" threatened the first computation models, quan tum error correction theory was formulated and applied not only to computation theory but also to communication theory to make it un conditionally secure. As soon as liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments started to approach their limits, solid-based nuclear spin experiments—the Kane computer—came in. As soon as it was proved that it is theoretically impossible to completely distinguish photon Bell states, three new approaches appeared: hyperentanglement, the use of continuous variables, and the Knill-Laflamme-Milburn proposal. There are many more such examples. What facilitated all these breakthroughs is the fact that at the present stage of development of quantum computation and communication, we deal with elementary quantum systems consisting of several two-level systems. The complexity of handling and controlHng such simple sys tems in a laboratory has turned out to be tremendous, but the basic physical models we follow and calculate for the systems themselves are not equally intricate."

Linear algebra,"Rao, A. Ramachandra","The vector space approach to the treatment of linear algebra is useful for geometric intuition leading to transparent proofs; it's also useful for generalization to infinite-dimensional spaces. The Indian School, led by Professors C.R. Rao and S.K. Mitra, successfully employed this approach. This book follows their approach and systematically develops the elementary parts of matrix theory, exploiting the properties of row and column spaces of matrices. Developments in linear algebra have brought into focus several techniques not included in basic texts, such as rank-factorization, generalized inverses, and singular value decomposition. These techniques are actually simple enough to be taught at the advanced undergraduate level. When properly used, they provide a better understanding of the topic and give simpler proofs, making the subject more accessible to students. This book explains these techniques."

While working on the lecture notes, we came to understand that one can recognize the true spirit of a scienti?c discipline only by viewing its contributions in the framework of science as a whole. We present computer science here as a fundamental science that, interacting with other scienti?c disciplines, changed and changes our view on the world, that contributes to our understanding of the fundamental concepts of science and that sheds new light on and brings new meaning to several of these concepts. We show that computer science is a discipline that discovers spectacular, unexpected facts, that ?nds ways out in seemingly unsolvable s- uations, and that can do true wonders. The message of this book is that computer science is a fascinating research area with a big impact on the real world, full of spectacular ideas and great ch- lenges. It is an integral part of science and engineering with an above-average dynamic over the last 30 years and a high degree of interdisciplinarity. The goal of this book is not typical for popular science writing, whichoftenrestrictsitselftooutliningtheimportanceofaresearch area. Whenever possible we strive to bring full understanding of the concepts and results presented."
Lectures on discrete geometry,"Matousek, Jiri","Discrete geometry investigates combinatorial properties of configurations of geometric objects. To a working mathematician or computer scientist, it offers sophisticated results and techniques of great diversity and it is a foundation for fields such as computational geometry or combinatorial optimization. This book is primarily a textbook introduction to various areas of discrete geometry. In each area, it explains several key results and methods, in an accessible and concrete manner. It also contains more advanced material in separate sections and thus it can serve as a collection of surveys in several narrower subfields. The main topics include: basics on convex sets, convex polytopes, and hyperplane arrangements; combinatorial complexity of geometric configurations; intersection patterns and transversals of convex sets; geometric Ramsey-type results; polyhedral combinatorics and high-dimensional convexity; and lastly, embeddings of finite metric spaces into normed spaces. Jiri Matousek is Professor of Computer Science at Charles University in Prague. His research has contributed to several of the considered areas and to their algorithmic applications. This is his third book."

Woman in white,"Collins, Wilkie","Wilkie Collins's classic thriller took the world by storm on its first appearance in 1859, with everything from dances to perfumes to dresses named in honor of the ""woman in white."" The novel's continuing fascination stems in part from a distinctive blend of melodrama, comedy, and realism; and in part from the power of its story. The catalyst for the mystery is Walter Hartright's encounter on a moonlit road with a mysterious woman dressed head to toe in white. She is in a state of confusion and distress, and when Hartright helps her find her way back to London she warns him against an unnamed ""man of rank and title."" Hartright soon learns that she may have escaped from an asylum and finds to his amazement that her story may be connected to that of the woman he secretly loves. Collins brilliantly uses the device of multiple narrators to weave a story in which no one can be trusted, and he also famously creates, in the figure of Count Fosco, the prototype of the suave, sophisticated evil genius. The Woman in White is still passed as a masterpiece of narrative drive and excruciating suspense. Introduction by Nicholas Rance"

Advances in speech coding,"Atal, Bishnu S.","Speech coding has been an ongoing area of research for several decades, yet the level of activity and interest in this area has expanded dramatically in the last several years. Important advances in algorithmic techniques for speech coding have recently emerged and excellent progress has been achieved in producing high quality speech at bit rates as low as 4.8 kb/s. Although the complexity of the newer more sophisticated algorithms greatly exceeds that of older methods (such as ADPCM), today's powerful programmable signal processor chips allow rapid technology transfer from research to product development and permit many new cost-effective applications of speech coding. In particular, low bit rate voice technology is converging with the needs of the rapidly evolving digital telecom munication networks. The IEEE Workshop on Speech Coding for Telecommunications was held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, from September 5 to 8, 1989. The objective of the workshop was to provide a forum for discussion of recent developments and future directions in speech coding. The workshop attracted over 130 researchers from several countries and its technical program included 51 papers."

"Public expenditures, growth, and poverty : lessons from developing countries","Fan, Shenggen","Public Expenditures, Growth, and Poverty assesses the efficacy of poverty reduction programs in Latin America, Africa, and Asia by synthesizing studies conducted by the International Food Policy Research Institute over the past ten years. Overall, the studies find that investments in agricultural research, infrastructure, and human capital are beneficial in the long term, while food aid and poverty reduction programs have little utility beyond immediately abating hunger and generating short-run income effects. The book develops a conceptual framework for analyzing public expenditures and their short- and long-run impact on poverty through various channels. It surveys spending trends and analyzes the effect of growing public investment on urban and rural poverty through case studies of India, China, Thailand, and Uganda. And it highlights the advantages of directing spending toward public works programs that engage impoverished peoples rather than using the limited aid money on food subsidies and other passive donations. Featuring discussions about the roles of various social safety net programs and a chapter devoted solely to the vexing poverty in sub-Saharan Africa, Public Expenditures, Growth, and Poverty will aid policy makers and encourage further, more analytic study of worldwide poverty reduction programs."

Theological origins of modernity,"Gillespie, Michael Allen","Exposing the religious roots of our ostensibly godless age, Michael Allen Gillespie reveals in this landmark study that modernity is much less secular than conventional wisdom suggests. Taking as his starting point the collapse of the medieval world, Gillespie argues that from the very beginning moderns sought not to eliminate religion but to support a new view of religion and its place in human life. He goes on to explore the ideas of such figures as William of Ockham, Petrarch, Erasmus, Luther, Descartes, and Hobbes, showing that modernity is best understood as a series of attempts to formulate a new and coherent metaphysics or theology. “Bringing the history of political thought up to date and situating it against the backdrop of contemporary events, Gillespie’s analyses provide us a way to begin to have conversations with the Islamic world about what is perhaps the central question within each of the three monotheistic religions: if God is omnipotent, then what is the place of human freedom?”—Joshua Mitchell, Georgetown University"

Algorithmic learning in a random world,"Vovk, Vladimir","Algorithmic Learning in a Random World describes recent theoretical and experimental developments in building computable approximations to Kolmogorov's algorithmic notion of randomness. Based on these approximations, a new set of machine learning algorithms have been developed that can be used to make predictions and to estimate their confidence and credibility in high-dimensional spaces under the usual assumption that the data are independent and identically distributed (assumption of randomness). Another aim of this unique monograph is to outline some limits of predictions: The approach based on algorithmic theory of randomness allows for the proof of impossibility of prediction in certain situations. The book describes how several important machine learning problems, such as density estimation in high-dimensional spaces, cannot be solved if the only assumption is randomness."
Applications of data mining in computer security,"Barbara, Daniel","Data mining is becoming a pervasive technology in activities as diverse as using historical data to predict the success of a marketing campaign, looking for patterns in financial transactions to discover illegal activities or analyzing genome sequences. From this perspective, it was just a matter of time for the discipline to reach the important area of computer security. Applications Of Data Mining In Computer Security presents a collection of research efforts on the use of data mining in computer security. Applications Of Data Mining In Computer Security concentrates heavily on the use of data mining in the area of intrusion detection. The reason for this is twofold. First, the volume of data dealing with both network and host activity is so large that it makes it an ideal candidate for using data mining techniques. Second, intrusion detection is an extremely critical activity. This book also addresses the application of data mining to computer forensics. This is a crucial area that seeks to address the needs of law enforcement in analyzing the digital evidence."

"80 questions to understand India : history, mythology and religion","Baig, Murad Ali","Murad Ali Baig questions, not the importance of faith, but the capturing of all religions by the vested interests of professional priests claiming to be God’s sole selling agents leading to distortions, superstitions and religiosity that the founding sages would have abhorred. He analyzes the patrons of religion – the founding prophets, apostles, priests, rulers and the rich – and the common people whose offerings make the places of worship so rich. Murad provides interesting insights into how people the world over, especially in India, have been influenced by geography, sources of food, technological change, trade and by political and religious forces. He presents provocative questions and answers allowing readers to draw their own conclusions. Writing on religion can be volatile but fortunately he cannot be accused of prejudice when his answers equally impact Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, Sikhs and others."
Coming of photography in India,"Pinney, Christopher","Though photography reaches as far back as the sixteenth-century’s camera obscura projects, it wasn’t until the British colonial period that amateur photographers introduced their technology to the Indian subcontinent. By the end of the nineteenth century, however, India was at the center of a representational revolution. Was photography in India simply a void, waiting to be filled by pre-existing cultural and historical practice? Or was it disruptive, throwing up new opportunities, prophesying new social formations, and bringing anxieties about formerly secluded events and practices into a newly visible sphere? The Coming of Photography in India transcends traditional cultural and technological narratives in order to present a subtle and compelling account of the limits, possibilities, and consequences of photography. Examining technology in order to explain the dynamic incarnation of photographic practice as cure, poison, and prophecy, Christopher Pinney presents a bold account that will reward anyone with an interest in India, photography, or the history of the book. Accompanied by beautiful illustrations and a large number of previously unpublished images, this volume presents a sophisticated account of the “disturbance” that photography has brought to all of our lives."

This year’s conference attracted 73 submissions from 20 countries. Each s- mission was reviewed by at least three independent referees. In a departure from previous conferences, the ?nal selection of the papers making up the program was done through an electronic discussion spanning two weeks, without a physical meeting of the Program Committee (PC). Since the PC of FSTTCS is distributed across the globe, it is very di?cult to ?x a meeting whose time and venue is convenient for a substantial fraction of the PC. Given this, it was felt that an electronic discussion would enable all members to participate on a more equal footing in the ?nal selection. All reviews, scores, and comments were posted on a secure website, with a mechanism for making updates and automatically sending noti?cations by email to relevant members of the PC. All PC members participated actively in the discussion. The general feedback on the arrangement was very positive, so we hope to continue this in future years. We had ?ve invited speakers this year: Eric Allender, Sanjeev Arora, David Harel, Colin Stirling, and Uri Zwick. We thank them for having readily accepted our invitation to talk at the conference and for providing abstracts (and even full papers) for the proceedings."

From research to manuscript : a guide to scientific writing,"Katz, Michael J.","Observations Plus Recipes It has been said that science is the orderly collection of facts about the natural world. Scientists, however, are wary of using the word ‘fact. ’ ‘Fact’ has the feeling of absoluteness and universality, whereas scientific observations are neither ab- lute nor universal. For example, ‘children have 20 deciduous [baby] teeth’ is an observation about the real world, but scientists would not call it a fact. Some children have fewer deciduous teeth, and some have more. Even those children who have exactly 20 deciduous teeth use the full set during only a part of their childhood. When they are babies and t- dlers, children have less than 20 visible teeth, and as they grow older, children begin to loose their deciduous teeth, which are then replaced by permanent teeth. ‘Children have 20 deciduous [baby] teeth’ is not even a complete scientific sta- ment. For one thing, the statement ‘children have 20 deciduous teeth’ does not tell us what we mean by ‘teeth. ’ When we say “teeth,” do we mean only those that can seen be with the unaided eye, or do we also include the hidden, unerupted teeth? An observation such as ‘children have 20 deciduous teeth’ is not a fact, and, by itself, it is not acceptable as a scientific statement until its terms are explained: scientifically, ‘children have 20 deciduous teeth’ must be accompanied by definitions and qualifiers."
Coping with drought risk in agriculture and water supply systems,"Iglesias, Ana","Over the last three decades drought episodes have resulted in severe social problems in Mediterranean countries, receiving broad attention from the international scientific and policy communities. The experiences in the development and implementation of drought management plans highlight the success and challenges of coping with drought for societies with different vulnerabilities and emphasize risk-based drought management as a critical approach to mitigate the impacts associated to drought-induced water shortages. Based on these experiences and the current methods for evaluating risk, the book synthesises guidelines for drought management that link science and policy and that can be applied to other regions. The book comprises a collection of papers divided into four sections that appeal to a broad audience. First, the social and hydrological context of Mediterranean countries is presented, discussing the interactions that have resulted in the complex institutional framework, and highlighting the importance of stakeholder involvement and awareness building for successful drought management. This section emphasises the role of organizations, institutions, and civil stakeholders involved in drought preparedness and mitigation and/or on water management for designing effective risk based strategies that mitigate the effects of drought in agriculture and water supply systems. Second, the book presents an academic approach to risk evaluation, including characterization of drought episodes, development of indicators of risk in hydrological and agricultural systems, and analysis of the role of economic instruments and groundwater for risk mitigation. This section finalises with the description of an integrated method for evaluating social vulnerability based on indicators that include the capacity to anticipate, cope, and respond to drought. The third section includes a collection of case studies that include the description of effective measures taken in the past. These case studies provide the context for developing demand driven guidelines that may be applied to other regions. The authors of these chapters can be viewed as stakeholders in drought management, since they represent a broad range of sectors and institutions from Mediterranean European and North African countries. The topics addressed have implications for the international policy community interested in disaster mitigation, agricultural policy, and development. Finally a synthesis of the management actions is presented in four chapters. Monitoring and preparedness planning is the essential first step for moving from disaster to risk management in response to drought. The management actions related to agriculture and water supply systems are presented in two different chapters but with a common conceptual framework based on the use of drought indicators for evaluating the levels of drought risk (pre-alert, alert, and emergency), that allow establishing linkages between science and policy. The final chapter discuses the lessons learned and application to other regions."

Pattern recognition,"Theodoridis, Sergios","Pattern recognition currently comprises a vast body of methods supporting the development of numerous applications in many different areas of activity. The generally recognized relevance of pattern recognition methods and techniques lies, for the most part, in the general trend of ""intelligent"" task emulation, which has definitely pervaded our daily life. Robot assisted manufacture, medical diagnostic systems, forecast of economic variables, exploration of Earth's resources, and analysis of satellite data are just a few examples of activity fields where this trend applies. The pervasiveness of pattern recognition has boosted the number of task specific methodologies and enriched the number of links with other disciplines. As counterbalance to this dispersive tendency there have been, more recently, new theoretical developments that are bridging together many of the classical pattern recognition methods and presenting a new perspective of their links and inner workings. This book has its origin in an introductory course on pattern recognition taught at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Oporto University. From the initial core of this course, the book grew with the intent of presenting a comprehensive and articulated view of pattern recognition methods combined with the intent of clarifying practical issues with the aid of examples and applications to real-life data. The book is primarily addressed to undergraduate and graduate students attending pattern recognition courses of engineering and computer science curricula."
QRD-RLS adaptive filtering,"Apolinario, Jose Antonio","I feel very honoured to have been asked to write a brief foreword for this book on QRD-RLS Adaptive Filtering–asubjectwhichhas been close to my heart for many years. The book is well written and very timely – I look forward personally to seeing it in print. The editor is to be congratulated on assembling such a highly esteemed team of contributing authors able to span the broad range of topics and concepts which underpin this subject. In many respects, and for reasons well expounded by the authors, the LMS al- rithm has reigned supreme since its inception, as the algorithm of choice for prac- cal applications of adaptive ltering. However, as a result of the relentless advances in electronic technology, the demand for stable and ef cient RLS algorithms is growing rapidly – not just because the higher computational load is no longer such a serious barrier, but also because the technological pull has grown much stronger in the modern commercial world of 3G mobile communications, cognitive radio, high speed imagery, and so on."

Nano quantum and molecular computing : Implications to high level design and validation,"Shukla, Sandeep K.","One of the grand challenges in the nano-scopic computing era is guarantees of robustness. Robust computing system design is confronted with quantum physical, probabilistic, and even biological phenomena, and guaranteeing high reliability is much more difficult than ever before. Scaling devices down to the level of single electron operation will bring forth new challenges due to probabilistic effects and uncertainty in guaranteeing 'zero-one' based computing. Minuscule devices imply billions of devices on a single chip, which may help mitigate the challenge of uncertainty by replication and redundancy. However, such device densities will create a design and validation nightmare with the shear scale. The questions that confront computer engineers regarding the current status of nanocomputing material and the reliability of systems built from such miniscule devices, are difficult to articulate and answer. We have found a lack of resources in the confines of a single volume that at least partially attempts to answer these questions. We believe that this volume contains a large amount of research material as well as new ideas that will be very useful for some one starting research in the arena of nanocomputing, not at the device level, but the problems one would face at system level design and validation when nanoscopic physicality will be present at the device level."

Death at my doorstep : obituaries,"Singh, Khushwant","For Khushwant Singh who wrote his own obituary in his twenties, death is not sacred but he reflects on it increasingly these days. In Death At My Doorstep, a collection of obituaries written over the years, he presents the dead in death, as in life – good, bad or ugly. Be it on the twilight hours of Bhutto, the gory end of Sanjay Gandhi, the overbearing Lord Mountbatten, or on his pet Alsatian Simba, each obituary bears out his irreverence or affection. Cocking a snook at death, he has also penned his own epitaph. Yet outliving those whom he admired has moved him to tears, and many of his obituaries have left the reader with a heavy heart. While Death At My Doorstep is Khushwant Singh's demystification of death, it also ferries his message to Badey Mian, in the words of Allama Iqbal: Baagh-e-bahisht say mujhay hukm-e-safar diya thha kyon? Kaar-e-Jahaan daraaz hai, ab meyra intazaar kar. (Why did you order me out of the garden of paradise? I have a lot of work that remains unfulfilled; now you better wait for me.)"
Open : an autobiography,"Agassi, Andre","#1 NATIONAL BESTSELLER • Far more than a superb memoir about the highest levels of professional tennis, Open is the engrossing story of a remarkable life. • ""Agassi’s memoir is just as entrancing as his tennis game.” —Time “Honest in a way that such books seldom are.” —The New York Times Andre Agassi had his life mapped out for him before he left the crib. Groomed to be a tennis champion by his moody and demanding father, by the age of twenty-two Agassi had won the first of his eight grand slams and achieved wealth, celebrity, and the game’s highest honors. But as he reveals in this searching autobiography, off the court he was often unhappy and confused, unfulfilled by his great achievements in a sport he had come to resent. Agassi writes candidly about his early success and his uncomfortable relationship with fame, his marriage to Brooke Shields, his growing interest in philanthropy, and—described in haunting, point-by-point detail—the highs and lows of his celebrated career."

"Bio-inspired artificial intelligence : theories, methods, and technologies","Floreano, Dario","A comprehensive introduction to new approaches in artificial intelligence and robotics that are inspired by self-organizing biological processes and structures. New approaches to artificial intelligence spring from the idea that intelligence emerges as much from cells, bodies, and societies as it does from evolution, development, and learning. Traditionally, artificial intelligence has been concerned with reproducing the abilities of human brains; newer approaches take inspiration from a wider range of biological structures that that are capable of autonomous self-organization. Examples of these new approaches include evolutionary computation and evolutionary electronics, artificial neural networks, immune systems, biorobotics, and swarm intelligence—to mention only a few. This book offers a comprehensive introduction to the emerging field of biologically inspired artificial intelligence that can be used as an upper-level text or as a reference for researchers. Each chapter presents computational approaches inspired by a different biological system; each begins with background information about the biological system and then proceeds to develop computational models that make use of biological concepts.

Partial differential equations with numerical solutions,"Kumar, Nagendra","The book is intended for graduate students of Engineering, Mathematics and Physics. We have numerically solved Hyperbolic and Parabolic partial differential equations with various initial conditions using Finite Difference Method and Mathematica. Replacing derivatives by finite difference approximations in these differential equations in conjunction with boundary conditions and initial conditions lead to equations relating numerical solutions at various position and time. These relations are intricate in that numerical value of the solution at one particular position and time is related with that at several other position and time. We have surmounted the intricacies by writing programs in Mathematica 6.0 that neatly provide systematic tabulation of the numerical values for all necessary position and time. This enabled us to plot the solutions as functions of position and time. Comparison with analytic solutions revealed nearly perfect match in every case. We have demonstrated conditions under which the nearly perfect match can be obtained even for larger increments in position or time."

Natural image statistics : a probabilistic approach to early computational vision,"Hyvarinen, Aapo","Aims and Scope This book is both an introductory textbook and a research monograph on modeling the statistical structure of natural images. In very simple terms, “natural images” are photographs of the typical environment where we live. In this book, their statistical structure is described using a number of statistical models whose parameters are estimated from image samples. Our main motivation for exploring natural image statistics is computational m- eling of biological visual systems. A theoretical framework which is gaining more and more support considers the properties of the visual system to be re?ections of the statistical structure of natural images because of evolutionary adaptation processes. Another motivation for natural image statistics research is in computer science and engineering, where it helps in development of better image processing and computer vision methods. While research on natural image statistics has been growing rapidly since the mid-1990s, no attempt has been made to cover the ?eld in a single book, providing a uni?ed view of the different models and approaches. This book attempts to do just that. Furthermore, our aim is to provide an accessible introduction to the ?eld for students in related disciplines."

"Battle for God : fundamentalism in Judaism, Christianity and Islam","Armstrong, Karen","In the late twentieth century, fundamentalism has emerged as one of the most powerful forces at work in the world, contesting the dominance of modern secular values and threatening peace and harmony around the globe. Yet it remains incomprehensible to a large number of people. In The Battle for God, Karen Armstrong brilliantly and sympathetically shows us how and why fundamentalist groups came into existence and what they yearn to accomplish. We see the West in the sixteenth century beginning to create an entirely new kind of civilization, which brought in its wake change in every aspect of life -- often painful and violent, even if liberating. Armstrong argues that one of the things that changed most was religion. People could no longer think about or experience the divine in the same way; they had to develop new forms of faith to fit their new circumstances. Armstrong characterizes fundamentalism as one of these new ways of being religious that have emerged in every major faith tradition. Focusing on Protestant fundamentalism in the United States, Jewish fundamentalism in Israel, and Muslim fundamentalism in Egypt and Iran, she examines the ways in which these movements, while not monolithic, have each sprung from a dread of modernity -- often in response to assault (sometimes unwitting, sometimes intentional) by the mainstream society. Armstrong sees fundamentalist groups as complex, innovative, and modern -- rather than as throwbacks to the past -- but contends that they have failed in religious terms. Maintaining that fundamentalism often exists in symbiotic relationship with an aggressive modernity, each impelling the other on to greater excess, she suggests compassion as a way to defuse what is now an intensifying conflict. BONUS: This edition contains an excerpt from Karen Armstrong's Twelve Steps to a Compassionate Life."

Software project management,"Hughes, Bob","Past experience with the development of software products indicates that there is much scope for improvement. Being design intensive, software projects run the risk of cost/schedule overruns besides remaining off the mark in satisfying the customers. The blame for the failures is very often attributed to inadequate project management rather than lack of competence in development. With the growth in the size and complexity of software projects and the corresponding design and development effort involved, the importance of formal software project management cannot be overemphasized. This book, in its second edition, comprehensively presents the essentials of theory and practice of software project management methodologies. The aim is to introduce the readers to the subject in a conceptual framework. The topics included in this edition are updated as per the ongoing trends in the field of software project management. There is an appendix on Metrics and Measurements. This title includes a list of abbreviations at the beginning of chapters. The book is well-suited for teaching an academic course of one semester or for conducting short training programmes for software engineers and project managers. Armed with updated concepts and ideas, software engineers and project managers will be able to plan every aspect of a project to ensure its timely implementation within the stipulated budget and required quality standards."

Gramsci is dead : anarchist currents in the newest social movements,"Day, Richard J. F.","""Inspired to contribute to the symbiotic relationship between the academic and activist worlds, Day has decided to pick up the pen instead of the Molotov cocktail. The result is this brilliant book."" Ann Hansen Ann was sentenced to life imprisonment for blowing up a cruise-missile component factory, and is the author of Direct Action: The Memoirs of an Urban Guerilla ""If revolutionary politics are to be reconstituted for the twenty-first century, all previously existing radical traditions must not only be remade but placed in new relationships with one another. The anarchism of Richard Day’s brilliant Gramsci is Dead is not only an explosive break-out from the demoralizing horizons of contemporary social democracy, but also an exuberant intellectual dance-invitation extended to all mutant Marxists, autonomists and species-being activists eager to catch the strains of a new tune: Red Emma would be proud."" Nick Dyer-Witheford, Associate Professor, University of Western Ontario and author of Cyber-Marx (1999) Gramsci and the concept of hegemony cast a long shadow over radical political theory. Yet how far has this theory got us? Is it still central to feminism, anti-capitalism, anti-racism, anarchism, and other radical social movements today? Unlike previous revolutionary movements, Day argues, most contemporary radical social movements do not strive to take control of the state. Instead, they attempt to develop new forms of self-organisation that can run in parallel with -- or as alternatives to -- existing forms of social, political, and economic organization. This is to say that they follow a logic of affinity rather than one of hegemony. This book draws together a variety of different strands in political theory to weave together an innovative new approach to politics today. Rigorous and wide-ranging, Day introduces and interrogates key concepts. From Hegel's concept of recognition, through theories of hegemony and affinity to Hardt and Negri's reflections on Empire, Day maps academia's theoretical and philosophical concerns onto today's politics of the street. Ideal for all students of political theory, Day's fresh approach combines Marxist, Anarchist and Post-structuralist theory to shed new light on the politics and practice of contemporary social movements."

Modern foundations of quantum optics,"Vedral, Vlatko","This textbook offers a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the basic ideas in modern quantum optics, beginning with a review of the whole of optics, and culminating in the quantum description of light. The book emphasizes the phenomenon of interference as the key to understanding the behavior of light, and discusses distinctions between the classical and quantum nature of light. Laser operation is reviewed at great length and many applications are covered, such as laser cooling, Bose condensation and the basics of quantum information and teleportation. Quantum mechanics is introduced in detail using the Dirac notation, which is explained from first principles. In addition, a number of non-standard topics are covered such as the impossibility of a light-based Maxwell's demon, the derivation of the Second Law of thermodynamics from the first-order time-dependent quantum perturbation theory, and the concept of Berry's phase. The book emphasizes the physical basics much more than the formal mathematical side, and is ideal for a first, yet in-depth, introduction to the subject. Five sets of problems with solutions are included to further aid understanding of the subject.

Present at the creation : the story of CERN and the large hadron collider,"Aczel, Amir D.","The Large Hadron Collider is the biggest, and by far the most powerful, machine ever built. A project of CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, its audacious purpose is to re-create, in a 16.5-mile-long circular tunnel under the French-Swiss countryside, the immensely hot and dense conditions that existed some 13.7 billion years ago within the first trillionth of a second after the fiery birth of our universe. The collider is now crashing protons at record energy levels never created by scientists before, and it will reach even higher levels by 2013. Its superconducting magnets guide two beams of protons in opposite directions around the track. After accelerating the beams to 99.9999991 percent of the speed of light, it collides the protons head-on, annihilating them in a flash of energy sufficient—in accordance with Einstein’s elegant statement of mass-energy equivalence, E=mc2—to coalesce into a shower of particles and phenomena that have not existed since the first moments of creation. Within the LHC’s detectors, scientists hope to see empirical confirmation of key theories in physics and cosmology. In telling the story of what is perhaps the most anticipated experiment in the history of science, Amir D. Aczel takes us inside the control rooms at CERN at key moments when an international team of top researchers begins to discover whether this multibillion-euro investment will fulfill its spectacular promise. Through the eyes and words of the men and women who conceived and built CERN and the LHC—and with the same clarity and depth of knowledge he demonstrated in the bestselling Fermat’s Last Theorem—Aczel enriches all of us with a firm grounding in the scientific concepts we will need to appreciate the discoveries that will almost certainly spring forth when the full power of this great machine is finally unleashed. Will the Higgs boson make its breathlessly awaited appearance, confirming at last the Standard Model of particles and their interactions that is among the great theoretical achievements of twentieth-century physics? Will the hidden dimensions posited by string theory be revealed? Will we at last identify the nature of the dark matter that makes up more than 90 percent of the cosmos? With Present at the Creation, written by one of today’s finest popular interpreters of basic science, we can all follow the progress of an experiment that promises to greatly satisfy the curiosity of anyone who ever concurred with Einstein when he said, “I want to know God’s thoughts—the rest is details.”"

Lectures on the hyperreals : an introduction to nonstandard analysis,"Goldblatt, Robert","An introduction to nonstandard analysis based on a course given by the author. It is suitable for beginning graduates or upper undergraduates, or for self-study by anyone familiar with elementary real analysis. It presents nonstandard analysis not just as a theory about infinitely small and large numbers, but as a radically different way of viewing many standard mathematical concepts and constructions. It is a source of new ideas, objects and proofs, and a wealth of powerful new principles of reasoning. The book begins with the ultrapower construction of hyperreal number systems, and proceeds to develop one-variable calculus, analysis and topology from the nonstandard perspective. It then sets out the theory of enlargements of fragments of the mathematical universe, providing a foundation for the full-scale development of the nonstandard methodology. The final chapters apply this to a number of topics, including Loeb measure theory and its relation to Lebesgue measure on the real line. Highlights include an early introduction of the ideas of internal, external and hyperfinite sets, and a more axiomatic set-theoretic approach to enlargements than is usual."

Alone together : why we expect more from technology and less from each other,"Turkle, Sherry","Consider Facebook - it's human contact, only easier to engage with and easier to avoid. Developing technology promises closeness. Sometimes it delivers, but much of our modern life leaves us less connected with people and more connected to simulations of them. In Alone Together, MIT technology and society professor Sherry Turkle explores the power of our new tools and toys to dramatically alter our social lives. It's a nuanced exploration of what we are looking for - and sacrificing - in a world of electronic companions and social networking tools, and an argument that, despite the hand-waving of today's self-described prophets of the future, it will be the next generation who will chart the path between isolation and connectivity."

How NASA builds teams.,"Pellerin, Charles J.","The must-read summary of Charles J. Pellerin's book: ""How NASA Builds Teams: Mission Critical Soft Skills for Scientists, Engineers, and Project Teams"". This complete summary of the ideas from Charles J. Pellerin's book ""How NASA Builds Teams"" shows that team building must take account of the personalities and expertise of the individual members. Scientists and technical experts often respond to a different type of team building to arts people. Through a great deal of trial and error, NASA has developed the 4-D team building strategy, which has proved very successful. 4-D can also be applied to leadership training. Every team must be Cultivating (so that everyone is feeling appreciated), Including, Visioning (everyone must think about the team’s future) and Directing (willing to take action to further the team’s success). This summary explains how the system used by NASA (an organisation with massively high stakes, both in terms of human life and money) can be applied to any organisation. Added-value of this summary: • Save time • Understand key concepts • Increase your business knowledge To learn more, read ""How NASA Builds Teams"" and discover the key to building the best teams."

A superbly thrilling life' Guardian Claude Lévi-Strauss, the 'father of modern anthropology' and author of the classic Tristes tropiques, was one of the most influential intellectuals of the second half of the twentieth century. Dislodging Sartre, Camus and de Beauvoir from the pinnacle of French intellectual life in the 1950s, he brought about a sea change in Western thought and inspired a generation of thinkers and writers, including Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes and Jacques Lacan with his structuralist theories. Lévi-Strauss's bohemian childhood and later studies of the emerging discipline of anthropology in the field and the university led him to mix with intellectuals, artists and poets from all over Europe. Tracing the evolution of his ideas through interviews with the man himself, research into his archives and conversations with contemporary anthropologists, Wilcken explores and explains Lévi-Strauss's theories, revealing an artiste manqué who infused his academic writing with an artistic and poetic sensibility."

Commutative algebra with a view toward algebraic geometry,"Eisenbud, David","Commutative Algebra is best understood with knowledge of the geometric ideas that have played a great role in its formation, in short, with a view towards algebraic geometry. The author presents a comprehensive view of commutative algebra, from basics, such as localization and primary decomposition, through dimension theory, differentials, homological methods, free resolutions and duality, emphasizing the origins of the ideas and their connections with other parts of mathematics. Many exercises illustrate and sharpen the theory and extended exercises give the reader an active part in complementing the material presented in the text. One novel feature is a chapter devoted to a quick but thorough treatment of Grobner basis theory and the constructive methods in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry that flow from it. Applications of the theory and even suggestions for computer algebra projects are included. This book will appeal to readers from beginners to advanced students of commutative algebra or algebraic geometry. To help beginners, the essential ideals from algebraic geometry are treated from scratch. Appendices on homological algebra, multilinear algebra and several other useful topics help to make the book relatively self- contained. Novel results and presentations are scattered throughout the text."
Algebraic geodesy and geoinformatics,"Awange, Joseph L.","While preparing and teaching ‘Introduction to Geodesy I and II’ to undergraduate students at Stuttgart University, we noticed a gap which motivated the writing of the present book: Almost every topic that we taught required some skills in algebra, and in particular, computer algebra! From positioning to transformation problems inherent in geodesy and geoinformatics, knowledge of algebra and application of computer algebra software were required. In preparing this book therefore, we have attempted to put together basic concepts of abstract algebra which underpin the techniques for solving algebraic problems. Algebraic computational algorithms useful for solving problems which require exact solutions to nonlinear systems of equations are presented and tested on various problems. Though the present book focuses mainly on the two ?elds, the concepts and techniques presented herein are nonetheless applicable to other ?elds where algebraic computational problems might be encountered. In Engineering for example, network densi?cation and robotics apply resection and intersection techniques which require algebraic solutions. Solution of nonlinear systems of equations is an indispensable task in almost all geosciences such as geodesy, geoinformatics, geophysics (just to mention but a few) as well as robotics. These equations which require exact solutions underpin the operations of ranging, resection, intersection and other techniques that are normally used. Examples of problems that require exact solutions include; • three-dimensional resection problem for determining positions and orientation of sensors, e. g. , camera, theodolites, robots, scanners etc."

Operating systems : a spiral approach,"Elmasri, Ramez","Elmasri, Levine, and Carrick's ""spiral approach"" to teaching operating systems develops student understanding of various OS components early on and helps students approach the more difficult aspects of operating systems with confidence. While operating systems have changed dramatically over the years, most OS books use a linear approach that covers each individual OS component in depth, which is difficult for students to follow and requires instructors to constantly put materials in context. Elmasri, Levine, and Carrick do things differently by following an integrative or ""spiral"" approach to explaining operating systems. The spiral approach alleviates the need for an instructor to ""jump ahead"" when explaining processes by helping students ""completely"" understand a simple, working, functional system as a whole in the very beginning. This is more effective pedagogically, and it inspires students to continue exploring more advanced concepts with confidence."

The detailed coverage and pedagogical tools make this an ideal textbook for students and researchers enrolled in electrical engineering and related courses."
Flow : the psychology of optimal experience,"Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly","More than anything else, this book is an exploration of happiness. What makes us happy? How can we live a fulfilling life? These are no simple questions to ask, but author Csikszentmihalyi makes a compelling and clear argument as to how happiness can be obtained (in passing, he even gives simple explanations for consciousness and the meaning of life!).In doing so, the author touches on a lot of principles from ancient philosophies and religions, such as Stoicism and Buddhism. Yet the approach for a happy life set out in Flow is based upon scientific research, as opposed to rules and guidelines obtained from ancient wisdom. Not that there's anything wrong with ancient wisdom, but it's all the more impressive to see modern guidelines to happiness based on scientific research.So what does it come down to? On the one hand, happiness is not a destination where you arrive, but a condition that needs to be cultivated. It's affected by the information we let into our thoughts and the way we seek happiness. Csikszentmihalyi makes a clear distinction between pleasure seeking and enjoyment, where pleasure is externally focused and hence a temporary fix for happiness, while true enjoyment comes from within and is sustainable.On the other hand, it depends on how we engage in activities, and this is where flow enters the scene: the research shows surprisingly few moments of happiness occur when we're idle. While engaged in work, in creating something, in pursuit of some kind of goal, stretching our abilities to their limits, those are the moments when most of us experience true happiness. This is when we're in a state of flow.Paradoxically, this means we often feel happier when working than when engaged in what most people consider leisure time: watching TV, getting drunk, lying on a beach for a week. Flow provides a solution: when the principles are understood, many activities can be turned into rewarding experiences that contribute to our happiness, and who would say no to that?"

Example code throughout the book can be integrated into commercial products or used as templates to enable quick creation of productive software. The book covers both the ARM and Thumb instruction sets, covers Intel's XScale Processors, outlines distinctions among the versions of the ARM architecture, demonstrates how to implement DSP algorithms, explains exception and interrupt handling, describes the cache technologies that surround the ARM cores as well as the most efficient memory management techniques. A final chapter looks forward to the future of the ARM architecture considering ARMv6, the latest change to the instruction set, which has been designed to improve the DSP and media processing capabilities of the architecture.* No other book describes the ARM core from a system and software perspective. * Author team combines extensive ARM software engineering experience with an in-depth knowledge of ARM developer needs. * Practical, executable code is fully explained in the book and available on the publisher's Website. * Includes a simple embedded operating system."
Principles of linear systems and signals,"Lathi, B. P.","This introductory level book gives comprehensive treatment to signals and linear systems. In it, the physical appreciation of concepts is emphasized rather than the mere mathematical manipulation of symbols. Mathematics is used to enhance physical and intuitive understanding, instead of to prove axiomatic theory. This conveniently organized book is divided into five parts and allows for the flexible teaching of discrete-time and continuous-time systems. Wherever possible, theoretical results are interpreted heuristically and are supported by carefully chosen examples and analogies."

Bose in Nazi Germany,"Hayes, Romain","By the late 1930s, Subhas Chandra Bose had become disillusioned with Gandhi’s leadership of the Indian National Congress and the nationalist struggle. With the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, he resolved that India could only achieve freedom through a violent uprising. Two years later, in 1941, Bose went on to make a daring escape, via Afghanistan and Russia, to Berlin in search of an anti-British alliance. The Nazis seized Bose’s offer and the possibilities of an anti-British revolt in India, even envisaging German troops marching into the country as ‘liberators’. Meanwhile, thousands of British Indian troops captured in North Africa enlisted in the Wehrmacht hoping to join the Nazi march into India as they swore oaths to Hitler and Bose ‘in the fight for the freedom of India’. Yet for all their accord, the Bose-Nazi relationship remained complicated, full of ambivalences on both sides. This book for the first time, tells the story of Bose’s war years in Germany and examines his relationship with the Nazis. This period remains a deeply controversial moment in Indian history and has thus far been suffused with hagiography. Using rare German and Indian war records, Romain Hayes has written a nuanced, thoughtful, and vital account of these years, shedding light on an aspect of Bose that has till now remained in shadow."

Mughal architecture and gardens,"Michell, George","The buildings of Mughal India constitute one of the world's greatest architectural traditions. Whether it is the Taj Mahal in Agra, the Red Fort in Delhi or the palaces of Fatehpur Sikri, these and other similarly well-preserved monuments of the 16th and 17th centuries testify to the refined taste and unlimited resources of a line of powerful patrons, notably the emperors Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan. Mughal architecture is a remarkable hybrid that fuses building forms, techniques and decorative schemes imported from Iran and Central Asia with long-established Indian materials and techniques. The results are both structurally innovative and aesthetically spectacular, a testament to the genius of Indian masons and craftsmen. The first comprehensive survey of the subject in more than 20 years, this lavish volume documents nearly 100 Mughal sites and monuments in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Mughal Architecture and Gardens is enhanced by over 250 stunning colour photographs by Amit Pasricha, one of the most talented architectural photographers working today. His photographs are accompanied by over 80 specially commissioned building plans and site layouts. Sumptuously illustrated with a text by renowned architectural historian George Michell, this book is of interest to students and scholars as well as travellers and general readers. AUTHOR: George Michell is an architectural historian, specialising in ancient Indian architecture. He obtained his PhD from the School of Oriental African Studies, University of London, has directed courses on Asian architecture at the Architectural Association, London, and was co-editor of the journal Art and Archaeology Research Papers from 1972 to 1982. Since the 1980s, he has co-directed an international team of scholars and students at Vijayanagara, the medieval Hindu site in Karnataka. George Mitchell has also lectured at universities and museums throughout the USA, Europe, India and Australia. Among his many publications are The Royal Palaces of India, Islamic Heritage of the Deccan, Architecture of the Islamic World: Its History and Social Meaning and Palaces of Rajasthan. Amit Pasricha lives in New Delhi and comes from a family of photographers. A well-known architectural and social documentary photographer, his work has been exhibited in India, London and New York. His photographs have also been published in several books, including Dome over India: Rashtrapati Bhavan, Horizons: The Tata-India Century and India: Then and Now. Pasricha's most recent publication is the panoramic collector's edition, The Monumental India Book, winner of the Indian Tourism Award, 2008.

Poverty and social exclusion in India,World Bank,"Despite India’s record of rapid economic growth and poverty reduction over recent decades, rising inequality in the country has been a subject of concern among policy makers, academics, and activists alike. Poverty and Social Exclusion in India focuses on social exclusion, which has its roots in India’s historical divisions along lines of caste, tribe, and the excluded sex, that is, women. These inequalities are more structural in nature and have kept entire groups trapped, unable to take advantage of opportunities that economic growth offers. Culturally rooted systems perpetuate inequality, and, rather than a culture of poverty that afflicts disadvantaged groups, it is, in fact, these inequality traps that prevent these groups from breaking out. Combining rigorous quantitative research with a discussion of these underlying processes, this book finds that exclusion can be explained by inequality in opportunities, inequality in access to markets, and inequality in voice and agency. This report will be of interest to policy makers, development practitioners, social scientists, and academics working to foster equality in India."

Economics of growth,"Aghion, Philippe","A comprehensive, rigorous, and up-to-date introduction to growth economics that presents all the major growth paradigms and shows how they can be used to analyze the growth process and growth policy design. This comprehensive introduction to economic growth presents the main facts and puzzles about growth, proposes simple methods and models needed to explain these facts, acquaints the reader with the most recent theoretical and empirical developments, and provides tools with which to analyze policy design. The treatment of growth theory is fully accessible to students with a background no more advanced than elementary calculus and probability theory; the reader need not master all the subtleties of dynamic programming and stochastic processes to learn what is essential about such issues as cross-country convergence, the effects of financial development on growth, and the consequences of globalization. The book, which grew out of courses taught by the authors at Harvard and Brown universities, can be used both by advanced undergraduate and graduate students, and as a reference for professional economists in government or international financial organizations. The Economics of Growth first presents the main growth paradigms: the neoclassical model, the AK model, Romer's product variety model, and the Schumpeterian model. The text then builds on the main paradigms to shed light on the dynamic process of growth and development, discussing such topics as club convergence, directed technical change, the transition from Malthusian stagnation to sustained growth, general purpose technologies, and the recent debate over institutions versus human capital as the primary factor in cross-country income differences. Finally, the book focuses on growth policies—analyzing the effects of liberalizing market competition and entry, education policy, trade liberalization, environmental and resource constraints, and stabilization policy—and the methodology of growth policy design. All chapters include literature reviews and problem sets. An appendix covers basic concepts of econometrics."

Advanced calculus,"Fitzpatrick, Patrick M.","An authorised reissue of the long out of print classic textbook, Advanced Calculus by the late Dr Lynn Loomis and Dr Shlomo Sternberg both of Harvard University has been a revered but hard to find textbook for the advanced calculus course for decades.This book is based on an honors course in advanced calculus that the authors gave in the 1960's. The foundational material, presented in the unstarred sections of Chapters 1 through 11, was normally covered, but different applications of this basic material were stressed from year to year, and the book therefore contains more material than was covered in any one year. It can accordingly be used (with omissions) as a text for a year's course in advanced calculus, or as a text for a three-semester introduction to analysis.The prerequisites are a good grounding in the calculus of one variable from a mathematically rigorous point of view, together with some acquaintance with linear algebra. The reader should be familiar with limit and continuity type arguments and have a certain amount of mathematical sophistication. As possible introductory texts, we mention Differential and Integral Calculus by R Courant, Calculus by T Apostol, Calculus by M Spivak, and Pure Mathematics by G Hardy. The reader should also have some experience with partial derivatives.In overall plan the book divides roughly into a first half which develops the calculus (principally the differential calculus) in the setting of normed vector spaces, and a second half which deals with the calculus of differentiable manifolds."

Introduction to graph and hypergraph theory,"Voloshin, Vitaly I.","This book is for math and computer science majors, for students and representatives of many other disciplines (like bioinformatics, for example) taking courses in graph theory, discrete mathematics, data structures, algorithms. It is also for anyone who wants to understand the basics of graph theory, or just is curious. No previous knowledge in graph theory or any other significant mathematics is required. The very basic facts from set theory, proof techniques and algorithms are sufficient to understand it; but even those are explained in the text. Structurally, the text is divided into two parts where Part II is the generalisation of Part I. The first part discusses the key concepts of graph theory with emphasis on trees, bipartite graphs, cycles, chordal graphs, planar graphs and graph colouring. The second part considers generalisations of Part I and discusses hypertrees, bipartite hypergraphs, hypercycles, chordal hypergraphs, planar hypergraphs and hypergraph colouring. There is an interaction between the parts and within the parts to show how ideas of generalisations work. The main point is to exhibit the ways of generalisations and interactions of mathematical concepts from the very simple to the most advanced. One of the features of this text is the duality of hypergraphs. This fundamental concept is missing in graph theory (and in its introductory teaching) because dual graphs are not properly graphs, they are hypergraphs. However, as Part II shows, the duality is a very powerful tool in understanding, simplifying and unifying many combinatorial relations; it is basically a look at the same structure from the opposite (vertices versus edges) point of view."

India : brief history of a civilization,"Trautmann, Thomas R.","India: Brief History of a Civilization provides a brief overview of a very long period, allowing students to acquire a mental map of the entire history of Indian civilization in a short book. Most comprehensive histories devote a few chapters to the early history of India and an increasing number of pages to the more recent period, giving an impression that early history is mere background and that Indian civilization finds its fulfillment in the nation-state. Thomas R. Trautmann believes that the deep past lives on and is a valuable resource for understanding the present day and for creating a viable future. The result is a book that is short enough to read in a few sittings, but comprehensive in coverage--5,000 years of India in brief."

India rising : tales from a changing nation,"Balch, Oliver","India is on the up. Historically derided as the lumbering elephant of Asia, this vast sub-continent has quickened its pace. The economy is booming. Tens of millions have been pulled out of poverty. Software and service companies abound. Millionaire entrepreneurs are springing up at every turn. Bollywood is going global and Indian expats are flooding back home. What's more, these changes are occurring within the world's largest democracy - a far cry from neighbouring China. But who and what lies behind India's apparent ascendency? In India Rising Oliver Balch takes the voices and stories of everyday Indians and presents a fresh, vivid, highly personalised account of the changes as they are unfolding.Travelling the length and breadth of the country, Balch leads readers off the tourist trail and onto the streets of modern day India.

Leviathan,"Hobbes, Thomas","Thomas Hobbes argues for a social contract and rule by an absolute sovereign. Influenced by the English Civil War, Hobbes wrote that chaos or civil war-situations identified with a state of nature and the famous motto Bellum omnium contra omnes (""the war of all against all"")-could only be averted by strong central government. He thus denied any right of rebellion toward the social contract, which would be later added by John Locke and conserved by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. (However, Hobbes did discuss the possible dissolution of the State. Since the social contract was made to institute a state that would provide for the ""peace and defense"" of the people, the contract would become void as soon as the government no longer protected its citizens. By virtue of this fact, man would automatically return to the state of nature until a new contract is made)."

Monsoon of music,"Phukan, Mitra","If music be the food of love…four musicians are about to feast. Against the backdrop of a magnificent musical heritage and the haunting and timeless ragas that sweep through these stirring pages, Mitra Phukan presents the ambitious sitarist Kaushik Kashyap, already a ‘name’, who tours the world; Nomita, the shy, small-town vocalist, whom Kaushik’s parents have chosen for him; the beautiful, calm Sandhya Senapati and her handsome husband, who both seem to be hiding deep, dark secrets. As the eventful monsoon months give way to autumn, the characters come to a deeper understanding of themselves as their lives change dramatically and forever. By turns serious, deeply moving and utterly irreverent, Mitra Phukan’s eye for detail, her immense knowledge of Hindustani music and her profound understanding of human nature come together in this wonderfully evocative novel. “The duality between spirituality and materialism... old-world images and modern performers, a gentle satire on the ambitions of today’s youngsters... all find a place in the novel.”—The Hindu Published by Zubaan."

Inexplicable unhappiness of Ramu Hajjam,"Hassan, Taj","The only commodity not at a premium in the battle between the poor and the very poor is life. Deep in the neglected interiors of India the villages of Tesri and Bhagatpur lie on the same side of the river Kareh. While Bhagatpur is populated by the land-owning farmer caste, the low-castes live in Tesri eking a subsistence from looking after the needs of Bhagatpur's high-born - but not much less poor - populace. Neither side has ever questioned this balance of power because the received wisdom is to each their lot. Until the day the local barber Ramu Hajjam is beaten senseless for accidentally cutting Subedar Singh's cheek and his son, burning for revenge, realizes that the only justice open to them is the brutish kind the rebels provide... A spare simple tale that looks through crippling impoverishment centuries of caste divide and government neglect straight into the heart of a bereaved father."
Jinnah vs. Gandhi,"Matthews, Roderick","The modern history of South Asia is shaped by the personalities of its two most prominent politicians and ideologues – Mohammad Ali Jinnah and Mahatma Gandhi. Jinnah shaped the final settlement by consistently demanding Pakistan, and Gandhi defined the largely non-violent nature of the campaign. Each made their contribution by taking over and refashioning a national political party, which they came to personify. Theirs would seem, therefore, to be a story of success, yet for each of them, the story ended in a kind of failure. How did two educated barristers who saw themselves as heralds of a newly independent country come to find themselves on opposite ends of the political spectrum? How did Jinnah, who started out a secular liberal, end up a Muslim nationalist? How did a God-fearing moralist and social reformer like Gandhi become a national political leader? And how did their fundamental divergences lead to the birth of two new countries that have shaped the political history of the subcontinent? This book skilfully chronicles the incredible similarities and ultimate differences between the two leaders, as their admirers and detractors would have it and as they actually were."

"Concluding unscientific postscript to philosophical fragments, Volume 1","Kierkegaard, S?ren","In Philosophical Fragments the pseudonymous author Johannes Climacus explored the question: What is required in order to go beyond Socratic recollection of eternal ideas already possessed by the learner? Written as an afterword to this work, Concluding Unscientific Postscript is on one level a philosophical jest, yet on another it is Climacus's characterization of the subjective thinker's relation to the truth of Christianity. At once ironic, humorous, and polemical, this work takes on the ""unscientific"" form of a mimical-pathetical-dialectical compilation of ideas. Whereas the movement in the earlier pseudonymous writings is away from the aesthetic, the movement in Postscript is away from speculative thought. Kierkegaard intended Postscript to be his concluding work as an author. The subsequent ""second authorship"" after The Corsair Affair made Postscript the turning point in the entire authorship. Part One of the text volume examines the truth of Christianity as an objective issue, Part Two the subjective issue of what is involved for the individual in becoming a Christian, and the volume ends with an addendum in which Kierkegaard acknowledges and explains his relation to the pseudonymous authors and their writings. The second volume contains the scholarly apparatus, including a key to references and selected entries from Kierkegaard's journals and papers."
Machiavellian moment : florentine political thought and the Atlantic republican tradition,"Pocock, J. G. A.","Originally published in 1975, The Machiavellian Moment remains a landmark of historical and political thought. Celebrated historian J.G.A. Pocock looks at the consequences for modern historical and social consciousness arising from the ideal of the classical republic revived by Machiavelli and other thinkers of Renaissance Italy. Pocock shows that Machiavelli's prime emphasis was on the moment in which the republic confronts the problem of its own instability in time, which Pocock calls the ""Machiavellian moment."" After examining this problem in the works of Machiavelli, Guicciardini, and Giannotti, Pocock turns to the revival of republican ideology in Puritan England and in Revolutionary and Federalist America. He argues that the American Revolution can be considered the last great act of civic humanism of the Renaissance and he relates the origins of modern historicism to the clash between civic, Christian, and commercial values in eighteenth-century thought. This Princeton Classics edition of The Machiavellian Moment features a new introduction by Richard Whatmore."

India since 1980,"Ganguly, Sumit","This book considers the remarkable transformations that have taken place in India since 1980, a period that began with the assassination of the formidable Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Her death, and that of her son Rajiv seven years later, marked the end of the Nehru-Gandhi era. Although the country remains one of the few democracies in the developing world, many of the policies instigated by these earlier regimes have been swept away to make room for dramatic alterations in the political, economic and social landscape. Sumit Ganguly and Rahul Mukherji, two leading political scientists of South Asia, chart these developments with particular reference to social and political mobilization, the rise of the BJP and its challenge to Nehruvian secularism and the changes to foreign policy that, in combination with its meteoric economic development, have ensured India a significant place on the world stage."

This book investigates the everyday practices through which citizens of the world's largest democracy make claims on the state, asking whether, how, and why they engage public officials in the pursuit of social welfare. Drawing on extensive fieldwork in rural India, Kruks-Wisner demonstrates that claim-making is possible in settings (poor and remote) and among people (the lower classes and castes) where much democratic theory would be unlikely to predict it. Examining the conditions that foster and inhibit citizen action, she finds that greater social and spatial exposure - made possible when individuals traverse boundaries of caste, neighborhood, or village - builds citizens' political knowledge, expectations, and linkages to the state, and is associated with higher levels and broader repertoires of claim-making."

"Princes and painters in Mughal Delhi, 1707-1857","Dalrymple, William","A dazzling celebration of the art and artists of late-Mughal Delhi Between 1707 and 1857, Delhi was a hotbed of political intrigue and power struggles the Mughal Empire was on the decline and the British East India Company was emerging as a formidable power. In 1857, these tensions would culminate in the Mutiny that led to the end of Mughal dominion and the beginning of the British Raj. But this turbulent epoch also witnessed a burst of artistic innovation and experimentation. Delhis artists were increasingly employed by Company officials as well as the Mughal and regional courts, and thus became adept at improvising with a variety of techniques, creating traditional miniatures while continually experimenting with new European styles. Art historians are only now coming to recognize the richness and ingenuity of the work created in this period. With insightful essays by distinguished scholars, Princes and Painters is a stunning visual document of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Delhi."

"Cyber security: understanding cyber crimes, computer forensics and legal perspectives","Godbole, Nina S.","Cyberforensics is a fairly new word in the technology our industry, but one that n- ertheless has immediately recognizable meaning. Although the word forensics may have its origins in formal debates using evidence, it is now most closely associated with investigation into evidence of crime. As the word cyber has become synonymous with the use of electronic technology, the word cyberforensics bears no mystery. It immediately conveys a serious and concentrated endeavor to identify the evidence of crimes or other attacks committed in cyberspace. Nevertheless, the full implications of the word are less well understood. Cyberforensic activities remain a mystery to most people, even those fully immersed in the design and operation of cyber te- nology. This book sheds light on those activities in a way that is comprehensible not only to technology professionals but also to the technology hobbyist and those simply curious about the ?eld. When I started contributing to the ?eld of cybersecurity, it was an obscure ?eld, rarely mentioned in the mainstream media. According to the FBI, by 2009 organized crime syndicates were making more money via cybercrime than in drug traf?- ing. In spite of the rise in cybercrime and the advance of sophisticated threat actors online, the cyber security profession continues to lag behind in its ability to inves- gate cybercrime and understand the root causes of cyber attacks. In the late 1990s I worked to respond to sophisticated attacks as part of the U. S."

Skinning tree,"Sen, Srikumar","Nine-year-old Sabby lives in his imagination, at his grandmother's house in Calcutta. He lives in a family where the anglicised sophistication of bridge and dinner parties co-exist with Indian values and nationalism. Sabby's world is filled with the adventures of comic book heroes, tales from far and away, successfully pulling him away from the city that breathes outside his doorstep. But when the Japanese advance on India during World War II, Sabby finds himself being sent to a boarding school in northern India. In a regime of rules and punishments, the schoolboys are beaten and brutalized by the teachers; they are transformed into mirrors of their abusers. From the mindless killing of birds and animals, the bodies of their skinned trophies are thrown on to a cactus known as the Skinning Tree, the boys' thoughts turn to murder, which to them feels like a natural consequence of the pain inflicted on them. Conspiratorial whisperings and talk of killing and revenge spiral into a tragedy engulfing Sabby. Revisiting the ghosts of memory that haunted a boyhood, The Skinning Tree marks an evocative and elegant debut."

Liquid refuses to ignite,"Besseling, Dave","Can enlightenment come in a glass of lassi? Whether discussing the intricacies of etiquette in a Japanese love hotel while high on hallucinogens, expunging unholy thoughts in a monastic retreat in Thailand, or contemplating life, death and heartache in the murky lanes of Varanasi, ten years of sex, drugs and spiritual misfires bring artist and journalist Dave Besseling no closer to finding the eternal truth – whatever that may be. Then, a moment of clarity presents itself while sipping lassi in India’s holiest city. In a series of essays that define the travails of those who prefer life on the road, The Liquid Refuses to Ignite sees Dave and his possible alter-ego Dr. Heagney theorize upon, ruminate over and scoff at everything from Kurt Cobain to Kundalini. Hitting out at the modern traveller – the backpack-wearing self-professed outcasts who scour the world for meaning – Dave stumbles upon the epiphany he’s been searching for: behind the robes and the rituals of wise men everywhere, they’re selling the same thing – the answer to emptiness and need. And they’ve been selling it to him all along."

Stringer : a reporter's year in the Congo,"Sundaram, Anjan","Book of the Year, The Royal African Society (UK) In the powerful travel-writing tradition of Ryszard Kapuœciñski and V.S. Naipaul, a haunting memoir of a dangerous and disorienting year of self-discovery in one of the world’s unhappiest countries. In August 2005, Anjan Sundaram abandoned his path to a Yale Ph.D. in mathematics to travel to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and refashion himself as a journalist. He found a country that was diseased, corrupt, and poised on the cusp of war. When Sundaram is engaged as a “stringer” for the Associated Press, he becomes a chronicler for a country he’s just beginning to experience. Stringer is his searing portrait of life in this broken, lawless place, an account of the rocky education of a reporter. Sundaram describes the grueling reality of daily existence in the Congo, intimately outlining his own struggle to make sense of life in a world where cab rides can end at gunpoint and rebel generals are only a phone call away. As the city of Kinshasha descends into anarchy after a contested election, Sundaram takes shelter in a factory to file report after report even as other journalists flee. Oscillating between anger and loneliness and between melancholy and exhilaration, Stringer completely transports us not only to the Congo—but to the limits of sanity, reason, and experience."

"Cell phone nation : how mobile phones have revolutionized business, politics and ordinary life in India","Jeffrey, Robin","The cheap mobile phone is probably the most disruptive communications device in history, and in India its potential to stir up society is breath-taking. The number of phones in India increased more than twenty times in the last ten years, and by the end of 2012 India had more than 900 million mobile phone subscribers. The impact of the simplest version of the device has been deep. Village councils have banned unmarried girls from owning mobile phones. Families have debated whether new brides should surrender them. Cheap mobiles have become photo albums, music machines, databases, radios and flashlights. Religious images and uplifting messages continue to flood tens of millions of phones each day. Pornographers and criminals have found a tantalizing new tool. Political organizations have exploited a resource infinitely more effective than the printing press for carrying messages to workers, followers and voters. Cell Phone Nation masterfully probes the mobile phone universe in India - from the contests of great capitalists and governments to control Radio Frequency spectrum to the ways ordinary people build the troublesome, addictive device into their daily lives."

Theoretical minimum : what you need to know to start doing physics,"Susskind, Leonard","'For anyone who is determined to learn physics for real, looking beyond conventional popularizations, this is the ideal place to start. It gets directly to the important points, with nuggets of deep insight scattered along the way' Sean Carroll, physicist and author of The Particle at the End of the Universe In this stimulating primer, world-class physicist and father of string theory Leonard Susskind and citizen-scientist George Hrabovsky combine forces to provide the ultimate master class in modern physics. Unlike most popular physics books - which give readers a taste of what physicists know but not what they actually do - Susskind and Hrabovsky teach the skills you need to do physics yourself. Combining crystal-clear explanations of the laws of the universe with basic exercises, the authors cover the minimum - the theoretical minimum of the title - that readers need to master in order to move on to more advanced topics. In a lucid, engaging style, Susskind and Hrabovsky introduce the key concepts of modern physics, from classical mechanics to general relativity to quantum theory. Instead of shying away from the equations and maths that are essential to any understanding of physics, they provide a practical toolkit that you won't find in any other popular science book. The Theoretical Minimum is a book for anyone who has ever regretted not taking physics at university, who knows a little but is keen to know more-or who simply wants to learn how to think like a physicist."
Geometry by its history,"Ostermann, Alexander","In this textbook the authors present first-year geometry roughly in the order in which it was discovered.

The following three chapters explain the revolution in geometry due to the progress made in the field of algebra by Descartes, Euler and Gauss. Spatial geometry, vector algebra and matrices are treated in chapters 9 and 10. The last chapter offers an introduction to projective geometry, which emerged in the 19thcentury. Complemented by numerous examples, exercises, figures and pictures, the book offers both motivation and insightful explanations, and provides stimulating and enjoyable reading for students and teachers alike."

Org : the underlying logic of office,"Fisman, Raymond","We create organizations because we need to get a job done--something we couldn't do alone--and join them because we're inspired by their missions (and our paycheck). But once we're inside, these organizations rarely feel inspirational. Instead, we're often baffled by what we encounter: clueless managers, a lack of clear objectives, a seeming disregard for data, and the vast gulf between HR proclamations and our experience in the cubicle. So where did it all go wrong? In The Org, Ray Fisman and Tim Sullivan explain the tradeoffs that every organization faces, arguing that this everyday dysfunction is actually inherent to the very nature of orgs. The Org diagnoses the root causes of that malfunction, beginning with the economic logic of why organizations exist in the first place, then working its way up through the org's structure from the lowly cubicle to the CEO's office. Woven throughout with fascinating case studies-including McDonald's, al Qaeda, the Baltimore City Police Department, Procter and Gamble, the island nation of Samoa, and Google--The Org reveals why the give-and-take nature of organizations, while infuriating, nonetheless provides the best way to get the job done. You'll learn: The purpose of meetings and why they will never go away Why even members of al Qaeda are required to submit Travel & Expense reports What managers are good for How the army and other orgs balance marching in lockstep with fostering innovation Why it's the hospital administration-not the heart surgeon-who is more likely to save your life That CEOs often spend over 80% of their time in meetings-and why that's exactly where they should be (and why they get paid so much) Looking at life behind the red tape, The Org shows why the path from workshop to corporate behemoth is pockmarked with tradeoffs and competing incentives, but above all, demonstrates why organizations are central to human achievement."

Don't buy this book now! : the art of procrastination,"Perry, John","Are you someone who likes to put off until tomorrow what you could do today? Do you draw up to-do lists, only to get frustrated that you aren’t able to follow them through? This delightful book argues that procrastinators are often perfectionists, and structured procrastinating---doing one thing as a way of not doing something else---is sometimes extremely effective. And if you’re still stuck with that list of things to do, here is advice on how to tweak it so that it becomes more manageable: put something daunting, like “Learn Chinese” or “Renovate kitchen”, at the top; cleaning the house or doing the laundry is a great way to not do those things. Written with wry humour and peppered with a wealth of insights, Don’t Buy This Book Now! The Art of Procrastination proposes an ingenious programme for getting things done by putting them off; it’s a must-read for anyone who has ever accused themselves of being a slacker."

Blindspot : hidden biases of good people,"Banaji, Mahzarin R.","“Accessible and authoritative . . . While we may not have much power to eradicate our own prejudices, we can counteract them. The first step is to turn a hidden bias into a visible one. . . . What if we’re not the magnanimous people we think we are?”—The Washington Post I know my own mind. I am able to assess others in a fair and accurate way. These self-perceptions are challenged by leading psychologists Mahzarin R. Banaji and Anthony G. Greenwald as they explore the hidden biases we all carry from a lifetime of exposure to cultural attitudes about age, gender, race, ethnicity, religion, social class, sexuality, disability status, and nationality. “Blindspot” is the authors’ metaphor for the portion of the mind that houses hidden biases. Writing with simplicity and verve, Banaji and Greenwald question the extent to which our perceptions of social groups—without our awareness or conscious control—shape our likes and dislikes and our judgments about people’s character, abilities, and potential. In Blindspot, the authors reveal hidden biases based on their experience with the Implicit Association Test, a method that has revolutionized the way scientists learn about the human mind and that gives us a glimpse into what lies within the metaphoric blindspot. The title’s “good people” are those of us who strive to align our behavior with our intentions. The aim of Blindspot is to explain the science in plain enough language to help well-intentioned people achieve that alignment. By gaining awareness, we can adapt beliefs and behavior and “outsmart the machine” in our heads so we can be fairer to those around us. Venturing into this book is an invitation to understand our own minds. Brilliant, authoritative, and utterly accessible, Blindspot is a book that will challenge and change readers for years to come. Praise for Blindspot “Conversational . . . easy to read, and best of all, it has the potential, at least, to change the way you think about yourself.”—Leonard Mlodinow, The New York Review of Books “Banaji and Greenwald deserve a major award for writing such a lively and engaging book that conveys an important message: Mental processes that we are not aware of can affect what we think and what we do. Blindspot is one of the most illuminating books ever written on this topic.”—Elizabeth F. Loftus, Ph.D., distinguished professor, University of California, Irvine; past president, Association for Psychological Science; author of Eyewitness Testimony"

Here is the long-forgotten story of Begum Hazrat Mahal, queen of Awadh and the soul of the Indian revolt against the British, brought to vivid life by the author of Regards from the Dead Princess, a major bestseller in her native France. Begum was an orphan and a poetess who captured the attentions of King Wajid Ali Shah of Awadh and became his fourth wife. As his wife, she incited and led a popular uprising that would eventually prove to be the first step toward Indian independence. Begum was the very incarnation of resistance: As chief of the army and the government in Lucknow, she fought battles on the field for two years; she was a freedom fighter, a misunderstood mother, and an illicit lover. She was a remarkable woman who risked everything only to face the greatest betrayal of all."

Inseparable twins : paired principles to inspire young minds,"Lakkur, Naveen","Paired Principles to Inspire Young Minds Innovation resides in everyone. Innovative potential in a person cannot be fully realised if it is not properly nurtured. It takes determined efforts to do so. If that spirit is not cultivated in a timely and disciplined manner, then a person may lose faith in his/her ability or even struggle needlessly. Naveen Lakkur created this book with his unique set of a dozen paired codes primarily to rekindle that innate energy in every one of us; to enable all members of a team working towards a shared goal to realise their full potential and enjoy their journey towards that goal, be it an intrapreneurial or entrepreneurial mission. It is especially targeted at young minds who have that unstoppable zeal so as to help them avoid many of the hurdles and pitfalls that they will encounter in the pursuit of any ambitious goal. Everyone has limited time and the attention span is even less these days. Yet, there is one communication system that continues to capture the time, attention and imagination of human beings since the dawn of mankind and that is the art of story-telling. Rather than offer these twin principles in a dry, academic, typically business book way, the author is offering them to you in the form of set of parables in an easy to read and lucid style. These are interesting stories unravelling these paired tenets through the experienced eyes of two elephants, Appy & Poppy, whose chance meeting with a man called Lucky stimulates a series of conversations about the twelve twins. Each one of the twelve paired thoughts has the potential to inspire anyone to renew their energy that power People, Purpose & Performance."

Often beginning with the personal, Chaudhuri enquires into the nature of the secular in India, into the history of such categories as the West, the foreign, the global, and the exotic, and into the frequently torn and self-divided nature of modern Indian identity. Chaudhuri also makes a powerful case for thinking about Indian literature and culture in a way that departs strikingly from the parameters created since the publication of Midnight's Children and the consolidation of postcolonial studies. While his mode is broadly oppositional, it is also one of constant engagement with the positions he is arguing against."

Dead reckoning : memories of the 1971 Bangladesh War,"Bose, Sarmila","This ground-breaking book chronicles the 1971 war in South Asia by reconstituting the memories of those on opposing sides of the conflict. 1971 was marked by a bitter civil war within Pakistan and war between India and Pakistan, backed respectively by the Soviet Union and the United States. It was fought over the territory of East Pakistan, which seceded to become Bangladesh. Through a detailed investigation of events on the ground, Sarmila Bose contextualises and humanises the war while analysing what the events reveal about the nature of the conflict itself. The story of 1971 has so far been dominated by the narrative of the victorious side. All parties to the war are still largely imprisoned by wartime partisan mythologies. Bose reconstructs events via interviews conducted in Bangladesh and Pakistan, published and unpublished reminiscences in Bengali and English of participants on all sides, official documents, foreign media reports and other sources. Her book challenges assumptions about the nature of the conflict, and exposes the ways in which the 1971 war is still playing out in the region."

Beautiful thing : inside the secret world of Bombay's dance bars,"Faleiro, Sonia","""Both a tragic monument to the abused bar girls of Bombay and a celebration of their amazing resilience and spirit.""—William Dalrymple, bestselling author of The Anarchy Published in India to great acclaim and named a Time Out Subcontinental Book of the Year and an Observer Book of the Year, Beautiful Thing is a stunning piece of journalism that offers a rare firsthand glimpse into Bombay's notorious sex industry. Sonia Faleiro was a reporter in search of a story when she met nineteen-year-old Leela, a charismatic exotic dancer with a story to tell. Leela introduced Sonia to the underworld of Bombay's dance bars: a world of glamorous women; of fierce love, sex, and violence; of gangsters, police, prostitutes, and pimps. When an ambitious politician cashed in on a tide of false morality and had Bombay's dance bars wiped out, Leela's proud independence faced its greatest test. In a city where almost everyone is certain that someone, somewhere, is worse off than them, she fights to survive—and to win. In Beautiful Thing, Sonia Faleiro has crafted one of the most original works about India in years, an ""intimate and valuable book of literary reportage . . . [that] will break your heart several times over"" ( The New York Times). ""Reporting at its best.""—Junot Díaz, The Rumpus ""A glimpse into a frightening subculture . . . In lesser hands, these young people could have come off as clichés, but the author makes sure we care for them and root for them to survive a life that most will never understand.

Many-dimensional modal logics theory and applications,"Gabbay, Dov M.","Modal logics, originally conceived in philosophy, have recently found many applications in computer science, artificial intelligence, the foundations of mathematics, linguistics and other disciplines. Celebrated for their good computational behaviour, modal logics are used as effective formalisms for talking about time, space, knowledge, beliefs, actions, obligations, provability, etc. However, the nice computational properties can drastically change if we combine some of these formalisms into a many-dimensional system, say, to reason about knowledge bases developing in time or moving objects.To study the computational behaviour of many-dimensional modal logics is the main aim of this book. On the one hand, it is concerned with providing a solid mathematical foundation for this discipline, while on the other hand, it shows that many seemingly different applied many-dimensional systems (e.g., multi-agent systems, description logics with epistemic, temporal and dynamic operators, spatio-temporal logics, etc.) fit in perfectly with this theoretical framework, and so their computational behaviour can be analyzed using the developed machinery.We start with concrete examples of applied one- and many-dimensional modal logics such as temporal, epistemic, dynamic, description, spatial logics, and various combinations of these. Then we develop a mathematical theory for handling a spectrum of 'abstract' combinations of modal logics - fusions and products of modal logics, fragments of first-order modal and temporal logics - focusing on three major problems: decidability, axiomatizability, and computational complexity. Besides the standard methods of modal logic, the technical toolkit includes the method of quasimodels, mosaics, tilings, reductions to monadic second-order logic, algebraic logic techniques. Finally, we apply the developed machinery and obtained results to three case studies from the field of knowledge representation and reasoning: temporal epistemic logics for reasoning about multi-agent systems, modalized description logics for dynamic ontologies, and spatio-temporal logics.The genre of the book can be defined as a research monograph. It brings the reader to the front line of current research in the field by showing both recent achievements and directions of future investigations (in particular, multiple open problems). On the other hand, well-known results from modal and first-order logic are formulated without proofs and supplied with references to accessible sources.The intended audience of this book is logicians as well as those researchers who use logic in computer science and artificial intelligence. More specific application areas are, e.g., knowledge representation and reasoning, in particular, terminological, temporal and spatial reasoning, or reasoning about agents. And we also believe that researchers from certain other disciplines, say, temporal and spatial databases or geographical information systems, will benefit from this book as well.Key Features:• Integrated approach to modern modal and temporal logics and their applications in artificial intelligence and computer science• Written by internationally leading researchers in the field of pure and applied logic• Combines mathematical theory of modal logic and applications in artificial intelligence and computer science• Numerous open problems for further research• Well illustrated with pictures and tables"
Bones of the tiger : protecting the man-eaters of Nepal,"Mishra, Hemanta","Tiger conservation is one of today’s most pressing environmental issues. From a world population of approximately 100,000 tigers in 1900, these majestic carnivores have dwindled to less than 3,500 in the wild today, much of this due to poaching and habitat destruction. The author tells the fascinating story of one man’s quest to save the man-eating tigers of Nepal. Unique in explaining the real story of atypical tiger behavior—behavior that ultimately leads to conflict with humans, sometimes resulting in death—this book also includes stunning photos by renowned Japanese photographer Mashahiro Iijima."

Gandhi : my life is my message,"Quinn, Jason","How did this shy, unassuming lawyer transform himself into the leader of India’s freedom movement? Renouncing wealth, ambition and comfort, Gandhi led by example, becoming one with the people he sought to free, facing imprisonment, hardship and humiliation while never raising his voice in anger. His strategy of nonviolent protest would become the model for the US civil rights movement led by Martin Luther King, Jr. and continues to change history throughout the world. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, better known as the Mahatma or Great Soul, took on the might of the British Empire armed only with a message of love and non-violence. In Gandhi: Apostle of Peace we discover the man behind the legend, following him from his birth in the Indian coastal town of Porbandar in 1869, to the moment of his tragic death at the hands of an assassin in January 1948, just months after the Independence of India."

House with a thousand stories,"Kashyap, Aruni","It is 2002 and young Pablo, a city boy who has mostly lived a sheltered and privileged life in Guwahati, is visiting his ancestral village for his aunt’s wedding. This is his second time in Mayong, in rural Assam, since 1998, when he had come for a few days to attend his father’s best friend’s funeral.

Blind assassin,"Atwood, Margaret","“Ten days after the war ended, my sister Laura drove a car off a bridge.” These words are spoken by Iris Chase Griffen, married at eighteen to a wealthy industrialist but now poor and eighty-two. Iris recalls her far from exemplary life, and the events leading up to her sister’s death, gradually revealing the carefully guarded Chase family secrets. Among these is “The Blind Assassin,” a novel that earned the dead Laura Chase not only notoriety but also a devoted cult following. Sexually explicit for its time, it was a pulp fantasy improvised by two unnamed lovers who meet secretly in rented rooms and seedy cafés. As this novel-within-a-novel twists and turns through love and jealousy, self-sacrifice and betrayal, so does the real narrative, as both move closer to war and catastrophe. Margaret Atwood’s Booker Prize-winning sensation combines elements of gothic drama, romantic suspense, and science fiction fantasy in a spellbinding tale."

Gender trouble : feminism and the subversion of identity,"Butler, Judith","One of the most talked-about scholarly works of the past fifty years, Judith Butler’s Gender Trouble is as celebrated as it is controversial. Arguing that traditional feminism is wrong to look to a natural, 'essential' notion of the female, or indeed of sex or gender, Butler starts by questioning the category 'woman' and continues in this vein with examinations of 'the masculine' and 'the feminine'. Best known however, but also most often misinterpreted, is Butler's concept of gender as a reiterated social performance rather than the expression of a prior reality. Thrilling and provocative, few other academic works have roused passions to the same extent."
Philosophy of logical atomism,"Russell, Bertrand","Logical Atomism is a philosophy that sought to account for the world in all its various aspects by relating it to the structure of the language in which we articulate information. In The Philosophy of Logical Atomism, Bertrand Russell, with input from his young student Ludwig Wittgenstein, developed the concept and argues for a reformed language based on pure logic. Despite Russell’s own future doubts surrounding the concept, this founding and definitive work in analytical philosophy by one of the world’s most significant philosophers is a remarkable attempt to establish a novel way of thinking."

Transgressing boundaries : the advaitic songs of Shenkottai Avudai Akkal,"Natarajan, Kanchana","Shenkottai Sri Avudai Akkal, a remarkable eighteenth-century woman saint from Tamil Nadu, was a self-realised advaitin who sang passionately about the ecstasy of spiritual union with the Absolute. A desolate and stigmatised Brahmin child-widow, she was initiated into Vedanta by the great master Tiruvisainallur Shridhara Venkatesa Ayyawal. Her songs, a radical elision of the metaphysical sublime and personal devotion, are narrated through existential tropes sourced from daily life, and also offer a powerful critique of the oppressive orthodox socio-religious practices of that period. Composed in simple, colloquial Tamil, and bringing hope and solace to women in general and widows in particular for almost three centuries, these songs by Avudai Akkal were preserved within the oral tradition by Brahmin women of Tirunellveli district who sang them on all occasions. The songs were documented in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and have appeared in many Tamil publications. They appear in English translation for the first time in this book. Each song is accompanied by annotations and themed essays. Published by Zubaan."

"Image processing, analysis, and machine vision","Sonka, Milan","Image Processing, Analysis and Machine Vision represent an exciting part of modern cognitive and computer science. Following an explosion of inter est during the Seventies, the Eighties were characterized by the maturing of the field and the significant growth of active applications; Remote Sensing, Technical Diagnostics, Autonomous Vehicle Guidance and Medical Imaging are the most rapidly developing areas. This progress can be seen in an in creasing number of software and hardware products on the market as well as in a number of digital image processing and machine vision courses offered at universities world-wide. There are many texts available in the areas we cover - most (indeed, all of which we know) are referenced somewhere in this book. The subject suffers, however, from a shortage of texts at the 'elementary' level - that appropriate for undergraduates beginning or completing their studies of the topic, or for Master's students - and the very rapid developments that have taken and are still taking place, which quickly age some of the very good text books produced over the last decade or so.

Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms : a strategic approach,"Lee, R. C. T","Communication network design, VLSI layout and DNA sequence analysis are important and challenging problems that cannot be solved by naïve and straightforward algorithms. Thus, it is critical for a computer scientist to have a good knowledge of algorithm design and analysis. This book presents algorithm design from the viewpoint of strategies. Each strategy is introduced with many algorithms designed under the strategy. Each algorithm is presented with many examples and each example with many figures. In recent years, many approximation algorithms have been developed. Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms presents two important concepts clearly: PTAS and NPO-complete. This book also discusses the concept of NP-completeness before introducing approximation algorithms. Again, this is explained through examples which make sure that the students have a definite idea about this very abstract concept. In addition, this book also has a chapter on on-line algorithms. Each on-line algorithm is introduced by first describing the basic principle behind it. Amortized analysis is a new field in algorithm research. In this book, detailed descriptions are given to introduce this new and difficult-to-understand concept. This book can be used as a textbook by senior undergraduate students or master level graduate students in computer science."

"TCP/IP illustrated. Vol. 1, the protocols","Fall, Kevin R.","""For an engineer determined to refine and secure Internet operation or to explore alternative solutions to persistent problems, the insights provided by this book will be invaluable.""--Vint Cerf, Internet pioneer TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1, Second Edition, is a detailed and visual guide to today's TCP/IP protocol suite. Fully updated for the newest innovations, it demonstrates each protocol in action through realistic examples from modern Linux, Windows, and Mac OS environments. There's no better way to discover why TCP/IP works as it does, how it reacts to common conditions, and how to apply it in your own applications and networks. Building on the late W. Richard Stevens' classic first edition, author Kevin R. Fall adds his cutting-edge experience as a leader in TCP/IP protocol research, updating the book to fully reflect the latest protocols and best practices. He first introduces TCP/IP's core goals and architectural concepts, showing how they can robustly connect diverse networks and support multiple services running concurrently. Next, he carefully explains Internet addressing in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks. Then, he walks through TCP/IP's structure and function from the bottom up: from link layer protocols-such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi-through network, transport, and application layers. Fall thoroughly introduces ARP, DHCP, NAT, firewalls, ICMPv4/ICMPv6, broadcasting, multicasting, UDP, DNS, and much more. He offers extensive coverage of reliable transport and TCP, including connection management, timeout, retransmission, interactive data flow, and congestion control. Finally, he introduces the basics of security and cryptography, and illuminates the crucial modern protocols for protecting security and privacy, including EAP, IPsec, TLS, DNSSEC, and DKIM. Whatever your TCP/IP experience, this book will help you gain a deeper, more intuitive understanding of the entire protocol suite so you can build better applications and run more reliable, efficient networks."

Mixed-signal systems : a guide to CMOS circuit design,"Handkiewicz, Andrzej","A practical guide to the successful integration of digital and analog circuits Mixed-signal processing-the integration of digital and analog circuitry within computer systems-enables systems to take signals from the analog world and process them within a digital system. In fact, recent advances in VLSI technology performance now allow for the integration of digital and analog circuits on a single chip, a process that requires the use of analog pre- and post-processing systems such as converters, filters, sensors, drivers, buffers, and actuators. However, the lack of universal CAD tools for the synthesis, simulation, and layout of the analog part of the chip represents a design bottleneck of today's VLSI circuits. Mixed-Signal Systems: A Guide to CMOS Circuit Design presents a comprehensive general overview of the latest CMOS technology and covers the various computer systems that may be used for designing integrated circuits. Taking an original approach to one- and two-dimensional filter design, the author explores the many digital-oriented design systems, or silicon compilers, currently being used, and presents the basic methods, procedures, and tools used by each. In a thorough and systematic manner, the text: * Presents common features of digital-oriented design systems * Describes methods and tools that are not yet being applied in any compiler * Illustrates image processing systems that can be implemented on a single chip * Demonstrates the path from synthesis methods to the actual silicon assembly Essential reading for integrated circuit designers and developers of related computer programs, as well as advanced students of system design, this book represents an invaluable resource for anyone involved in the development of mixed-signal systems."

Gandhi : a spiritual biography,"Sharma, Arvind","DIV In his Autobiography, Gandhi wrote, “What I want to achieve—what I have been striving and pining to achieve these thirty years—is self-realization, to see God face to face. . . . All that I do by way of speaking and writing, and all my ventures in the political field, are directed to this same end.” While hundreds of biographies and histories have been written about Gandhi (1869–1948), nearly all of them have focused on the political, social, or familial dimensions of his life. Very few, in recounting how Gandhi led his country to political freedom, have viewed his struggle primarily as a search for spiritual liberation. Shifting the focus to the understudied subject of Gandhi’s spiritual life, Arvind Sharma retells the story of Gandhi’s life through this lens. Illuminating unsuspected dimensions of Gandhi’s inner world and uncovering their surprising connections with his outward actions, Sharma explores the eclectic religious atmosphere in which Gandhi was raised, his belief in reincarnation, his conviction that morality and religion are synonymous, his attitudes toward tyranny and freedom, and, perhaps most important, the mysterious source of his power to establish new norms of human conduct. This book enlarges our understanding of one of history’s most profoundly influential figures, a man whose trust in the power of the soul helped liberate millions. /div"

For the first time in history, Hinduism itself forms here the subject of generalization of a Hindu mind of the highest order. What Hinduism had needed was the organizing and consolidating of its own idea, a rock where she could lie at anchor, and an authoritative utterance in which she might recognise herself. What the world had needed was a faith that had no fear of truth. Both are found in the words and writings of Swami Vivekananda.

Cybersecurity and cyberwar : what everyone needs to know,"Singer, P. W.","A generation ago, ""cyberspace"" was just a term from science fiction, used to describe the nascent network of computers linking a few university labs. Today, our entire modern way of life, from communication to commerce to conflict, fundamentally depends on the Internet. And the cybersecurity issues that result challenge literally everyone: politicians wrestling with everything from cybercrime to online freedom; generals protecting the nation from new forms of attack, while planning new cyberwars; business executives defending firms from once unimaginable threats, and looking to make money off of them; lawyers and ethicists building new frameworks for right and wrong. Most of all, cybersecurity issues affect us as individuals. We face new questions in everything from our rights and responsibilities as citizens of both the online and real world to simply how to protect ourselves and our families from a new type of danger. And yet, there is perhaps no issue that has grown so important, so quickly, and that touches so many, that remains so poorly understood. In Cybersecurity and CyberWar: What Everyone Needs to Know®, New York Times best-selling author P. W. Singer and noted cyber expert Allan Friedman team up to provide the kind of easy-to-read, yet deeply informative resource book that has been missing on this crucial issue of 21st century life. Written in a lively, accessible style, filled with engaging stories and illustrative anecdotes, the book is structured around the key question areas of cyberspace and its security: how it all works, why it all matters, and what can we do? Along the way, they take readers on a tour of the important (and entertaining) issues and characters of cybersecurity, from the ""Anonymous"" hacker group and the Stuxnet computer virus to the new cyber units of the Chinese and U.S. militaries.

Either/or: part II,"Kierkegaard, S?ren","Søren Kierkegaard, the nineteenth-century Danish philosopher rediscovered in the twentieth century, is a major influence in contemporary philosophy, religion, and literature. He regarded Either/Or as the beginning of his authorship, although he had published two earlier works on Hans Christian Andersen and irony. The pseudonymous volumes of Either/Or are the writings of a young man (I) and of Judge William (II). The ironical young man's papers include a collection of sardonic aphorisms; essays on Mozart, modern drama, and boredom; and ""The Seducer's Diary."" The seeming miscellany is a reflective presentation of aspects of the ""either,"" the esthetic view of life. Part II is an older friend's ""or,"" the ethical life of integrated, authentic personhood, elaborated in discussions of personal becoming and of marriage. The resolution of the ""either/or"" is left to the reader, for there is no Part III until the appearance of Stages on Life's Way. The poetic-reflective creations of a master stylist and imaginative impersonator, the two men write in distinctive ways appropriate to their respective positions."
Fear and trembling: repetition,"Kierkegaard, S?ren","Presented here in a new translation, with a historical introduction by the translators, Fear and Trembling and Repetition are the most poetic and personal of Søren Kierkegaard's pseudonymous writings. Published in 1843 and written under the names Johannes de Silentio and Constantine Constantius, respectively, the books demonstrate Kierkegaard's transmutation of the personal into the lyrically religious. Each work uses as a point of departure Kierkegaard's breaking of his engagement to Regine Olsen--his sacrifice of ""that single individual."" From this beginning Fear and Trembling becomes an exploration of the faith that transcends the ethical, as in Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son Isaac at God's command. This faith, which persists in the face of the absurd, is rewarded finally by the return of all that the faithful one is willing to sacrifice. Repetition discusses the most profound implications of unity of personhood and of identity within change, beginning with the ironic story of a young poet who cannot fulfill the ethical claims of his engagement because of the possible consequences of his marriage. The poet finally despairs of repetition (renewal) in the ethical sphere, as does his advisor and friend Constantius in the aesthetic sphere. The book ends with Constantius' intimation of a third kind of repetition--in the religious sphere."

Antony and Cleopatra,"Shakespeare, William","Antony and Cleopatra dramatizes a major event in world history: the founding of the Roman Empire. The future first emperor, Octavius Caesar (later called Augustus Caesar), cold-bloodedly manipulates other characters and exercises iron control over himself. At first, he shares power with Mark Antony, Rome’s preeminent military leader, and the weaker Lepidus. Caesar needs Antony to fend off other Roman strongmen like Pompey; he even offers his sister Octavia to him as a bride, despite Antony’s reputation as a libertine and his past rivalry with Caesar. Once Caesar defeats Pompey, however, he needs no allies. He brings charges against Lepidus, denies Antony his spoils from Pompey’s defeat, and seizes cities in the eastern Roman colonies that Antony rules. The play’s emphasis, however, is on those whom Caesar defeats: Antony and his wealthy Egyptian ally, Queen Cleopatra. The play does not sugarcoat Antony and Cleopatra’s famous love affair, including her calculated attempts to seduce Antony from his duties and his rage when he thinks she has betrayed him to Caesar. Nonetheless, the lovers find such sensual and emotional satisfaction that Caesar’s world conquest seems smaller than what they find in each other. The authoritative edition of Antony and Cleopatra from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes: -Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play -Full explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play -Scene-by-scene plot summaries -A key to the play’s famous lines and phrases -An introduction to reading Shakespeare’s language -An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play -Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library’s vast holdings of rare books -An annotated guide to further reading Essay by Cynthia Marshall The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is home to the world’s largest collection of Shakespeare’s printed works, and a magnet for Shakespeare scholars from around the globe.

If so, then William Shakespeare’s ""Julius Caesar"" should be your next must-read. This historical play will take you through all the complicated friendship dynamics and political conspiracies your heart desires. You will be drawn into the ultimate battle for power at hand, enthralling and topical, this is a play for today. First performed around 1599, as the successor of the British monarchy was on uncertain grounds, Julius Caesar is confronted by the dangers of political turmoil. Will Caesar achieve his desire to become an unassailable dictator, or will his aspirations only be in vain? This play stands, not only at the turn of a century but at the point in which Shakespeare emerged as the leading English language writer. William Shakespeare (1564-1616) is widely considered the world's greatest dramatist and is often referred to as England's national poet or the Bard. Most famous for his timeless plays, he also wrote a multitude of poems and sonnets. Shakespeare was the blockbuster writer of his day, his many works concerning universal themes of life, love, death, revenge, grief, jealousy, murder, magic, and mystery. Among some of his most famous are ""Macbeth"", ""Romeo and Juliet"", and ""Hamlet"", but the list is long, and many continue to be studied and performed, both their original form and modern adaptations."

Annihilation of caste,"Ambedkar, B. R.","“What the Communist Manifesto is to the capitalist world, Annihilation of Caste is to India.” —Anand Teltumbde, author of The Persistence of Caste The classic work of Indian Dalit politics, reframed with an extensive introduction by Arundathi Roy B.R. Ambedkar’s Annihilation of Caste is one of the most important, yet neglected, works of political writing from India. Written in 1936, it is an audacious denunciation of Hinduism and its caste system. Ambedkar – a figure like W.E.B. Du Bois – offers a scholarly critique of Hindu scriptures, scriptures that sanction a rigidly hierarchical and iniquitous social system. The world’s best-known Hindu, Mahatma Gandhi, responded publicly to the provocation. The hatchet was never buried. Arundhati Roy introduces this extensively annotated edition of Annihilation of Caste in “The Doctor and the Saint,” examining the persistence of caste in modern India, and how the conflict between Ambedkar and Gandhi continues to resonate. Roy takes us to the beginning of Gandhi’s political career in South Africa, where his views on race, caste and imperialism were shaped. She tracks Ambedkar’s emergence as a major political figure in the national movement, and shows how his scholarship and intelligence illuminated a political struggle beset by sectarianism and obscurantism. Roy breathes new life into Ambedkar’s anti-caste utopia, and says that without a Dalit revolution, India will continue to be hobbled by systemic inequality."

Kalkatta,"Basu, Kunal","Jami is the Gigolo King of Kalkatta. Smuggled into India from Bangladesh and given refuge by his uncle, a leader of the ruling Communist Party, he grows up in Zakaria Street—a Little Baghdad of the old—dreaming of becoming a pukka Kalkatta-wallah. When friendship with a local gang disqualifies him from school, he ends up as assistant to a passport forger, and then a masseur. Soon enough, innocent massage leads to ‘plus plus treatments’, and Kalkatta opens its doors, drawing Jami into the world of the rich and famous, housewives, tourists and travelling executives, and occasionally to high-paying and dangerous ‘parties’. Danger looms, too, from rivals and the police, and the ever-present risk of losing his cover. Jami’s shadowy double life takes a turn for the unexpected when he meets Pablo, a young boy who suffers from leukemia, and his single mother Mandira. Made to oscillate between his refugee family, the neighbourhood gang, his massage-parlour clients, even the cultured world of Bengali intellectuals inhabited by Mandira, he succeeds in becoming a true Kalkatta-wallah, but a stranger to himself. Until his love for Pablo threatens to destroy everything, and drive him away even from his beloved Kalkatta."

Poems, Poets, Poetry reflects her teaching to thousands of undergraduates in the core poetry course that she has taught at Harvard since 1981.- An innovative approach to reading and writing about poetry. Part One begins with a unique demonstration: Vendler first reads a dozen poems to show how they represent life events, then rereads the same dozen poems to reveal how poets use language to transform those events into memorable art. The author devotes the rest of the text to unfolding poetry's layers: formal, thematic, linguistic, lyric, social, historical, and evaluative. To illustrate this, Vendler examines 65 poems, and provides prompts to help students read 106 others. Two new chapters in Part Two illuminate ways to think and write about both individual works and groups of poems.- An ample and diverse anthology of 268 poems by 128 poets. Spanning eight centuries of English-language poetry, the anthology in Part Three offers a broad choice of canonical and contemporary selections that includes one of the most extensive collections of multicultural American poetry available in an introductory text."

Bodies of song : Kabir oral traditions and performative worlds in North India,"Hess, Linda","Kabir was a great iconoclastic-mystic poet of fifteenth-century North India; his poems were composed orally, written down by others in manuscripts and books, and transmitted through song. Scholars and translators usually attend to written collections, but these present only a partial picture of the Kabir who has remained vibrantly alive through the centuries mostly in oral forms. Entering the worlds of singers and listeners in rural Madhya Pradesh, Bodies of Song combines ethnographic and textual study in exploring how oral transmission and performance shape the content and interpretation of vernacular poetry in North India. The book investigates textual scholars' study of oral-performative traditions in a milieu where texts move simultaneously via oral, written, audio/video-recorded, and electronic pathways. As texts and performances are always socially embedded, Linda Hess brings readers into the lives of those who sing, hear, celebrate, revere, and dispute about Kabir. Bodies of Song is rich in stories of individuals and families, villages and towns, religious and secular organizations, castes and communities. Dialogue between religious/spiritual Kabir and social/political Kabir is a continuous theme throughout the book: ambiguously located between Hindu and Muslim cultures, Kabir rejected religious identities, pretentions, and hypocrisies. But even while satirizing the religious, he composed stunning poetry of religious experience and psychological insight. A weaver by trade, Kabir also criticized caste and other inequalities and today serves as an icon for Dalits and all who strive to remove caste prejudice and oppression."

For Jhumpa Lahiri, that love was for Italian, which first captivated and capsized her during a trip to Florence after college. Although Lahiri studied Italian for many years afterwards, true mastery had always eluded her. Seeking full immersion, she decided to move to Rome with her family, for 'a trial by fire, a sort of baptism' into a new language and world. There, she began to read and to write – initially in her journal – solely in Italian. In Other Words, an autobiographical work written in Italian, investigates the process of learning to express oneself in another language, and describes the journey of a writer seeking a new voice. Presented in a dual-language format, this is a wholly original book about exile, linguistic and otherwise, written with an intensity and clarity not seen since Vladimir Nabokov: a startling act of self-reflection and a provocative exploration of belonging and reinvention."
Revolutionary history of interwar India,"Maclean, Kama","Focusing on the Hindustan Socialist Republican Army (HSRA), A Revolutionary History . . . delivers a fresh perspective on the ambitions, ideologies and practices of this influential organization formed by Chandrashekhar Azad and Bhagat Singh, and inspired by transnational anti-imperial dissent. It is a new interpretation of the activities and political impact of the north Indian revolutionaries who advocated the use of political violence against the British. Kama Maclean contends that the actions of these revolutionaries had a direct impact on Congress politics and tested its policy of non-violence. In doing so she draws on visual culture studies, demonstrating the efficacy of imagery in constructing—as opposed to merely illustrating—historical narratives. Maclean analyses visual evidence alongside recently declassified government files, memoirs and interviews to elaborate on the complex relationships between the Congress and the HSRA, which were far less antagonistic than is frequently imagined."

Textbook of communication skills,"Patel, Vitthal","Communication Skills offers a comprehensive exploration of what sets effective communicators apart, presenting a systematic approach to developing crucial interpersonal abilities. Built upon three fundamental pillarsâmessage clarity, audience adaptation, and feedback interpretationâthis guide challenges the notion that communication skills are purely innate, instead demonstrating how they can be methodically developed through understanding and practice. The book combines insights from cognitive psychology, linguistics, and organizational behavior to create a robust framework for improvement. The text progresses logically through three major sections, beginning with the cognitive foundations of communication, moving to practical message delivery techniques across various mediums, and culminating in advanced topics like cross-cultural communication and conflict resolution. What sets this work apart is its evidence-based approach, incorporating data from communication laboratories, workplace surveys, and real-world case studies from successful business leaders. Each chapter includes practical exercises, assessment tools, and reflection questions, making complex concepts accessible and actionable. Particularly valuable for professionals seeking career advancement and leaders aiming to improve team dynamics, the book provides concrete tools like communication planning templates and scenario-based exercises. While maintaining academic rigor, it presents information in clear, accessible language, focusing specifically on verbal and written communication skills. The book's structured approach to skill development, combined with its incorporation of current topics like digital communication dynamics and AI's role in future interactions, makes it an essential resource for anyone looking to enhance their communication effectiveness in both professional and personal contexts."

Conquest and community : the afterlife of warrior saint ghazi miyan,"Amin, Shahid","Conquest and Community, by prize-winning historian Shahid Amin, is a kaleidoscopic look into one of the most divisive issues in South Asian history: the Turkic conquest of the subcontinent and the subsequent spread of Muslim rule. Covering more than eight hundred years of history, the book centers around the enduringly popular saint Ghazi Miyan, the youthful and lovable soldier of Islam to whom shrines have been erected all over the country. After detailing the warrior saint s supposed exploits, Amin charts the various ways he has been remembered throughout the last millennium. As he shows, the charming stories, ballads, and proverbs that grew up around him domesticated the bloody conquest and made it appear both virtuous and familial. Amin brings the story of Ghazi Miyan s long afterlife into the contemporary period through his ethnographic analysis of the still-active shrines as sites of interreligious public piety. What is at first glance a story of just one mythical figure becomes through Amin s thoughtful treatment an allegory for the history of Hindu-Muslim relations over an astonishingly long period of time. As the Muslim conquest of India is being mobilized for dangerously polarizing political ends in India today, this nonsectarian account of religious strife will be a timely and sane contribution to the vexed historical debate."""

"Introduction to embedded systems, 2nd ed.: a cyber-physical systems approach","Ashford, edward","An introduction to the engineering principles of embedded systems, with a focus on modeling, design, and analysis of cyber-physical systems. The most visible use of computers and software is processing information for human consumption. The vast majority of computers in use, however, are much less visible. They run the engine, brakes, seatbelts, airbag, and audio system in your car. They digitally encode your voice and construct a radio signal to send it from your cell phone to a base station. They command robots on a factory floor, power generation in a power plant, processes in a chemical plant, and traffic lights in a city. These less visible computers are called embedded systems, and the software they run is called embedded software. The principal challenges in designing and analyzing embedded systems stem from their interaction with physical processes. This book takes a cyber-physical approach to embedded systems, introducing the engineering concepts underlying embedded systems as a technology and as a subject of study. The focus is on modeling, design, and analysis of cyber-physical systems, which integrate computation, networking, and physical processes. The second edition offers two new chapters, several new exercises, and other improvements. The book can be used as a textbook at the advanced undergraduate or introductory graduate level and as a professional reference for practicing engineers and computer scientists. Readers should have some familiarity with machine structures, computer programming, basic discrete mathematics and algorithms, and signals and systems."

Invention of private life,"Kaviraj, Sudipta","The essays in this volume, which lie at the intersection of the study of literature, social theory, and intellectual history, locate serious reflections on modernity's complexities in the vibrant currents of modern Indian literature, particularly in the realms of fiction, poetry, and autobiography. Sudipta Kaviraj shows that Indian writers did more than adopt new literary trends in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. They deployed these innovations to interrogate fundamental philosophical questions of modernity. Issues central to modern European social theory grew into significant themes within Indian literary reflection, such as the influence of modernity on the nature of the self, the nature of historicity, the problem of evil, the character of power under the conditions of modern history, and the experience of power as felt by an individual subject of the modern state. How does modern politics affect the personality of a sensitive individual? Is love possible between intensely self-conscious people, and how do individuals cope with the transience of affections or the fragility of social ties? Kaviraj argues that these inquiries inform the heart of modern Indian literary tradition and that writers, such as Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay, Rabindranath Tagore, and Sibnath Sastri, performed immeasurably important work helping readers to think through the predicament of modern times."

Fiction as history : the novel and the city in modern north India,"Dalmia, Vasudha","Explains the Hindi novel’s role in anticipating and creating the story of middle-class modernity and modernization in North India. Vasudha Dalmia offers a panoramic view of the intellectual and cultural life of North India over a century, from the aftermath of the 1857 uprising to the end of the Nehruvian era. The North’s historical cities, rooted in an Indo-Persianate culture, began changing more slowly than the Presidency towns founded by the British. Dalmia takes up eight canonical Hindi novels set in six of these cities—Agra, Allahabad, Banaras, Delhi, Lahore, and Lucknow—to trace a literary history of domestic and political cataclysms. Her exploration of the emerging Hindu middle classes, changing personal and professional ambitions, and new notions of married life provides a vivid sense of urban modernity. She argues that the radical social transformations associated with post-1857 urban restructuring, and the political flux resulting from social reform, Gandhian nationalism, communalism, Partition, and the Cold War shaped the realm of the intimate as much as the public sphere. Love and friendship, notions of privacy, attitudes to women’s work, and relationships within households are among the book’s major themes."
"Gandhi's battlefield choice : the mahatma, the bhagavad gita, and world war II","Hutchins, Francis G.","This much anticipated volume compares and contrasts Gandhi’s non-violent leadership during World War II to the military leadership of Arjuna in the war that prompted the Bhagavad Gita dialogue, the Sanskrit text that guided Gandhi’s actions throughout his life. Early in his career as leader of India’s campaign to end British rule, Gandhi resisted terrorist interpretations of the Gita and described the Gita as depicting a metaphorical battle between good and evil impulses within every human heart. Then when India was drawn into a world war not unlike that in which Arjuna reluctantly led his troops into combat, Gandhi embraced his role as battlefield commander of the millions he had trained to be non-violent warriors. Never abandoning his dedication to non-violence, Gandhi stressed to his recruits that they should act as non-violently as possible but should not passively accept injustice. Remaining true to the Bhagavad Gita while responding to urgent hazards affecting all Indians, Gandhi himself became a wartime battlefield commander leading millions in the climactic Quit India conflict that ended British rule. The volume provides an overview of Gandhi’s entire career as leader of the Indian Nationalist Movement, clarifies Gandhi’s approach to acting non-violently when surrounded by violence, and affirms Gandhi’s enduring importance as a source of inspiration around the world.

Mathematics across the iron curtain,"Hollings, Christopher","The theory of semigroups is a relatively young branch of mathematics, with most of the major results having appeared after the Second World War. This book describes the evolution of (algebraic) semigroup theory from its earliest origins to the establishment of a full-fledged theory. Semigroup theory might be termed `Cold War mathematics' because of the time during which it developed. There were thriving schools on both sides of the Iron Curtain, although the two sides were not always able to communicate with each other, or even gain access to the other's publications. A major theme of this book is the comparison of the approaches to the subject of mathematicians in East and West, and the study of the extent to which contact between the two sides was possible."

Ramsey theory on the integers,"Landman, Bruce M.","Ramsey theory is the study of the structure of mathematical objects that is preserved under partitions. In its full generality, Ramsey theory is quite powerful, but can quickly become complicated. By limiting the focus of this book to Ramsey theory applied to the set of integers, the authors have produced a gentle, but meaningful, introduction to an important and enticing branch of modern mathematics. Ramsey Theory on the Integers offers students a glimpse into the world of mathematical research and the opportunity for them to begin pondering unsolved problems. For this new edition, several sections have been added and others have been significantly updated. Among the newly introduced topics are: rainbow Ramsey theory, an ""inequality"" version of Schur's theorem, monochromatic solutions of recurrence relations, Ramsey results involving both sums and products, monochromatic sets avoiding certain differences, Ramsey properties for polynomial progressions, generalizations of the Erdős-Ginzberg-Ziv theorem, and the number of arithmetic progressions under arbitrary colorings. Many new results and proofs have been added, most of which were not known when the first edition was published. Furthermore, the book's tables, exercises, lists of open research problems, and bibliography have all been significantly updated. This innovative book also provides the first cohesive study of Ramsey theory on the integers. It contains perhaps the most substantial account of solved and unsolved problems in this blossoming subject. This breakthrough book will engage students, teachers, and researchers alike."

Mutually beneficial relationship of graphs and matrices,"Brualdi, Richard A.","Graphs and matrices enjoy a fascinating and mutually beneficial relationship. This interplay has benefited both graph theory and linear algebra. In one direction, knowledge about one of the graphs that can be associated with a matrix can be used to illuminate matrix properties and to get better information about the matrix. Examples include the use of digraphs to obtain strong results on diagonal dominance and eigenvalue inclusion regions and the use of the Rado-Hall theorem to deduce properties of special classes of matrices. Going the other way, linear algebraic properties of one of the matrices associated with a graph can be used to obtain useful combinatorial information about the graph. The adjacency matrix and the Laplacian matrix are two well-known matrices associated to a graph, and their eigenvalues encode important information about the graph. Another important linear algebraic invariant associated with a graph is the Colin de Verdiere number, which, for instance, characterizes certain topological properties of the graph. This book is not a comprehensive study of graphs and matrices. The particular content of the lectures was chosen for its accessibility, beauty, and current relevance, and for the possibility of enticing the audience to want to learn more."
Travels with a donkey in the cevennes,"Stevenson, Robert Louis","Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes (1879) is one of Robert Louis Stevenson's earliest published works and is considered a pioneering classic of outdoor literature. Background Stevenson was in his late 20s and still dependent on his parents for support. His journey was designed to provide material for publication while allowing him to distance himself from a love affair with an American woman of which his friends and families did not approve and who had returned to her husband in California. Travels recounts Stevenson's 12-day, 200-kilometre (120 mi) solo hiking journey through the sparsely populated and impoverished areas of the Cévennes mountains in south-central France in 1878.[1] The terrain, with its barren rocky heather-filled hillsides, he often compared to parts of Scotland. The other principal character is Modestine, a stubborn, manipulative donkey he could never quite master. It is one of the earliest accounts to present hiking and camping outdoors as a recreational activity. It also tells of commissioning one of the first sleeping bags, large and heavy enough to require a donkey to carry. Stevenson is several times mistaken for a peddler, the usual occupation of someone traveling in his fashion. Some locals are horrified that he would sleep outdoors and suggest it is dangerous to do so because of wolves or robbers. Stevenson provides the reader with the philosophy behind his undertaking:[2] For my part, I travel not to go anywhere, but to go. I travel for travel's sake. The great affair is to move; to feel the needs and hitches of our life more clearly; to come down off this feather-bed of civilization, and find the globe granite underfoot and strewn with cutting flints. Alas, as we get up in life, and are more preoccupied with our affairs, even a holiday is a thing that must be worked for. To hold a pack upon a pack-saddle against a gale out of the freezing north is no high industry, but it is one that serves to occupy and compose the mind. And when the present is so exacting who can annoy himself about the future? The Cévennes was the site of a Protestant rebellion around 1702, severely suppressed by Catholic Louis XIV. The Protestant insurgents were known as the Camisards. Stevenson was Protestant by upbringing, and a non-believer by philosophy. Stevenson was well-versed in the history and evokes scenes from the rebellion as he passes through the area of the rebellion during the final days of his trek. He notes that the Catholics and the Protestants, at the time of his travels, live peaceably alongside one another, though each community is faithful to its own traditions and its version of the region's history. All disapprove equally of a young Catholic man who married a Protestant girl and changed his faith, agreeing that ""It's a bad idea for a man to change."" As for a Catholic priest who left the priesthood and married, the sentiment common to all was that it is wrong to change one's commitments. The book appeared the following year, 1879, and is dedicated to his friend Sidney Colvin, an art historian and critic who had befriended him when he was unpublished and seeking to develop a career as a writer."
Writing gender history,"Downs, Laura Lee","How has feminist scholarship changed history? Writing Gender History explores the evolution of historical writing about women and gender from the 1930s until the early twenty-first century. With chapters on the history of Europe, the USA, colonial India and Africa, the disucssion moves from women's history to gender history, and then to poststructuralist challenges to that history. This revised edition includes an exciting new chapter looking at recent scholarship on race, gender and sexuality in colonial and transnational history, and on the history of the body. Highly accessibly but also encouraging new debate, this book provides students with a comprehensive understanding of gender history, as well as its possible future. Reviews of the first edition: 'Ingenuity and perspicuity shine through Laura Lee Downs' superb distillation and analysis of women's and gender history. To understand accomplishments and changes in the field, put this book at the top of your list.' Nancy F. Cott, Professor of American History, Harvard University. 'Puts the entire range of women's and gender history into context, showing how it challenges the conventional pieties, opens up new veins of research, and transforms our understanding of every aspect of history. Her command of the literature is simply astounding... Sure to be seen as a landmark in the development of the field of history in the broadest sense.'

Dharma reader,"Olivelle, Patrick","Whether defined by family, lineage, caste, professional or religious association, village, or region, India's diverse groups did settle on a concept of law in classical times. How did they reach this consensus? Was it based on religious grounds or a transcendent source of knowledge? Did it depend on time and place? And what apparatus did communities develop to ensure justice was done, verdicts were fair, and the guilty were punished? Addressing these questions and more, A Dharma Reader traces the definition, epistemology, procedure, and process of Indian law from the third century B.C.E. to the middle ages. Its breadth captures the centuries-long struggle by Indian thinkers to theorize law in a multiethnic and pluralist society. The volume includes new and accessible translations of key texts, notes that explain the significance and chronology of selections, and a comprehensive introduction that summarizes the development of various disciplines in intellectual-historical terms. It reconstructs the principal disputes of a given discipline, which not only clarifies the arguments but also relays the dynamism of the fight. For those seeking a richer understanding of the political and intellectual origins of a major twenty-first-century power, along with unique insight into the legal interactions among its many groups, this book offers exceptional detail, historical precision, and expository illumination."

"On art, literature and history : the non-fiction writing of Naguib Mahfouz","Mahfouz, Naguib","Naguib Mahfouz, the Arab world’s only Nobel literature laureate, is best known internationally for his short stories and novels, including The Cairo Trilogy. But in Egypt he was equally familiar to newspaper readers for the column he wrote for many years in the leading daily Al-Ahram, in which he reflected on issues of the day from domestic and international events, politics, and economics to historic anniversaries, inspirational personalities, and questions of cultural freedom. This volume brings together the 285 articles he wrote between January 1989 and the near-fatal knife attack in October 1994. In carefully crafted short texts, his social conscience is revealed as he highlights political shortcomings, economic injustice, and corruption in Egypt and the wider Arab world. His philosophical sensitivity comes to the fore as he contemplates the meaning of a historic events, contributions of an influential people, and what is required to lead a good life. The collapse of the Soviet Union, the Oslo peace accords, the spread of terrorism, the Cairo earthquake, the passing of Louis Awad, Yusuf Idris, Yahya Hakki, the third term of Hosni Mubarak, climate change, and more come under Naguib Mahfouz’s fine scrutiny. For any fan of Mahfouz’s fiction, this collection opens a window on a different side of his intellect, and it offers insights from one of the region’s greatest modern minds."

Outside the lettered city,"Dass, Manishita","Outside the Lettered City traces how middle-class Indians responded to the rise of the cinema as a popular form of mass entertainment in early 20th century India, focusing on their preoccupation with the mass public made visible by the cinema and with the cinema's role as a public sphere and a mass medium of modernity. It draws on archival research to uncover aspirations and anxieties about the new medium, which opened up tantalizing possibilities for nationalist mobilization on the one hand, and troubling challenges to the cultural authority of Indian elites on the other. Using case-studies drawn from the film cultures of Bombay and Kolkata, it demonstrates how discourses about the cinematic public dovetailed into discourses about a national public, giving rise to considerable excitement about cinema's potential to democratize the public sphere beyond the limits of print-literate culture, as well as to deepening anxieties about cultural degeneration. The case-studies also reveal that early twentieth century discourses about the cinema contain traces of a formative tension in Indian public culture, between visions of a deliberative public and spectres of the unruly masses."

Story of collapsing stars,"Joshi, Pankaj S.","This book journeys into one of the most fascinating intellectual adventures of recent decades - understanding and exploring the final fate of massive collapsing stars in the universe. The issue is of great interest in fundamental physics and cosmology today, from both the perspective of gravitation theory and of modern astrophysical observations. This is a revolution in the making and may be intimately connected to our search for a unified understanding of the basic forces of nature, namely gravity that governs the cosmological universe, and the microscopic forces that include quantum phenomena. According to the general theory of relativity, a massive star that collapses catastrophically under its own gravity when it runs out of its internal nuclear fuel must give rise to a space-time singularity. Such singularities are regions in the universe where all physical quantities take their extreme values and become arbitrarily large. The singularities may be covered within a black hole, or visible to faraway observers in the universe. Thus, the final fate of a collapsing massive star is either a black hole or a visible naked singularity. We discuss here recent results and developments on the gravitational collapse of massive stars and possible observational implications when naked singularities happen in the universe. Large collapsing massive stars and the resulting space-time singularities may even provide a laboratory in the cosmos where one could test the unification possibilities of basic forces of nature."
Rooster bar,"Grisham, John","#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • John Grisham’s newest legal thriller takes you inside a law firm that’s on shaky ground. Mark, Todd, and Zola came to law school to change the world, to make it a better place. But now, as third-year students, these close friends realize they have been duped. They all borrowed heavily to attend a third-tier, for-profit law school so mediocre that its graduates rarely pass the bar exam, let alone get good jobs. And when they learn that their school is one of a chain owned by a shady New York hedge-fund operator who also happens to own a bank specializing in student loans, the three know they have been caught up in The Great Law School Scam. But maybe there's a way out. Maybe there’s a way to escape their crushing debt, expose the bank and the scam, and make a few bucks in the process. But to do so, they would first have to quit school. And leaving law school a few short months before graduation would be completely crazy, right? Well, yes and no ... Pull up a stool, grab a cold one, and get ready to spend some time at The Rooster Bar. Don’t miss John Grisham’s new book, THE EXCHANGE: AFTER THE FIRM!"

Man’s impulses and desires are equally social and solitary. Politics and ethics are the means by which we as a society and as individuals become socially purposeful and moral codes inculcate our rules of action."

Why men fight,"Russell, Bertrand","In ""Why Men Fight: A Method of Abolishing the International Duel,"" Bertrand Russell explores the underlying causes of war and conflict among nations, weaving together philosophy, psychology, and sociology into a compelling argument against militarism. Written during the interwar period, this thought-provoking work critiques the irrationality of warfare, challenging the glorification of nationalistic fervor and the dueling mentality that insidiously pervades international relations. Through a blend of rigorous reasoning and accessible prose, Russell advocates for a new approach centered on dialogue and cooperation, reflecting the broader pacifist movements of his time. Bertrand Russell, renowned philosopher, logician, and social critic, wrote this book during a tumultuous period marked by the aftermath of World War I and the looming threat of another global conflict. His experiences as a pacifist and his deep understanding of political philosophy undoubtedly informed his perspective. Russell's profound advocacy for reasoned discourse over violence can be traced to his lifelong commitment to social reform, as well as his critiques of dogma and oppression. This incisive work is essential for readers interested in the philosophical examinations of war and peace. Russell'Äôs arguments remain strikingly relevant today, offering not only a critique of militarism but also a timeless blueprint for resolving conflicts through understanding and compassion. Whether you're a student of philosophy or a concerned global citizen, ""Why Men Fight"" invites you to reflect on the moral imperatives that can shape a more peaceful world."
Drone,"Rothstein, Adam","""Drones are in the newspaper, on the TV screen, swarming through the networks, and soon, we're told, they'll be delivering our shopping. But what are drones? The word encompasses everything from toys to weapons. And yet, as broadly defined as they are, the word ""drone"" fills many of us with a sense of technological dread. Adam Rothstein cuts through the mystery, the unknown, and the political posturing, and talks about what drones really are: what technologies are out there, and what's coming next; how drones are talked about, and how they are represented in popular culture. It turns out that drones are not as scary as they appear-but they are more complicated than you might expect. Drones reveal the strange relationships that humans are forming with their new technologies""--Publisher."
Star wars : phasma,"Dawson, Delilah S.","NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Discover Captain Phasma’s mysterious history in this “Journey to Star Wars: The Last Jedi” novel. One of the most cunning and merciless officers of the First Order, Captain Phasma commands the favor of her superiors, the respect of her peers, and the terror of her enemies. But for all her renown, Phasma remains as virtually unknown as the impassive expression on her gleaming chrome helmet. Now, an adversary is bent on unearthing her mysterious origins—and exposing a secret she guards as zealously and ruthlessly as she serves her masters. Deep inside the Battlecruiser Absolution, a captured Resistance spy endures brutal interrogation at the hands of a crimson-armored stormtrooper—Cardinal. But the information he desires has nothing to do with the Resistance or its covert operations against the First Order. What the mysterious stormtrooper wants is Phasma’s past—and with it whatever long-buried scandal, treachery, or private demons he can wield against the hated rival who threatens his own power and privilege in the ranks of the First Order. His prisoner has what Cardinal so desperately seeks, but she won’t surrender it easily. As she wages a painstaking war of wills with her captor, bargaining for her life in exchange for every precious revelation, the spellbinding chronicle of the inscrutable Phasma unfolds. But this knowledge may prove more than just dangerous once Cardinal possesses it—and once his adversary unleashes the full measure of her fury. Praise for Phasma “Fury Road meets The Force Awakens . . . a much-needed origin story for one of the new Star Wars saga’s most mysterious characters.”—The Verge “Dark, gripping, and entertaining.”—Roqoo Depot “Fabulous, utterly engrossing.”—Kirkus Reviews"

Husain : portrait of an artist,"Pal, Ila","M.F. Husain was many things: curious boy from Pandharpur, painter of billboards, maker of toys, aesthete, the inveterate progressive artist he soon became, and later film-maker and style icon who walked about barefoot with a long brush in hand. A legend, in short. Six years after first seeing him on a rainy day outside the Jehangir Art Gallery in Mumbai, Ila Pal met the star painter for the first time in 1961. It was the beginning of a long and enriching association between an eager student of art and M.F. Husain - a journey that lasted fifty years. This book is a product of that intimate relationship. Filled with anecdotes about his charisma, his sharp wit, his sense of wonder about the world at large and his insatiable hunger for love, this warm and personalised biography traces his evolution through his many avatars. It attempts to unravel the enigma of M.F., who is considered the master of contemporary Indian art, and the auctions of whose works at Christie's and Sotheby's changed the Indian art market forever. It also delves into the artist's exile from his homeland at the fag end of his life, exploring the question of creative licence in a climate where people's sentiments are easily hurt and where censorship rules the roost like never before. Husain: Portrait of an Artist gives us an up close and personal look at the life of a great painter who was hated and admired by millions alike - the one and only Maqbool Fida Husain."

Text and tradition in South India,"Rao, Narayana Velcheru","Essays on Telugu and South Indian literature and culture by distinguished Telugu scholar Narayana Rao. Velcheru Narayana Raos contribution to understanding Indian cultural history, literary production, and intellectual lifespecifically from the vantage of the Andhra regionhas few parallels. He is one of the very rare scholars to be able to reflect magisterially on the precolonial and colonial periods. He moves easily between Sanskrit and the vernacular traditions, and between the worlds of orality and script. This is because of his mastery of the classical Telugu tradition. As Sanjay Subrahmanyam puts it in his Introduction, To command nearly a thousand years of a literary tradition is no small feat, but more important still is VNRs ability constantly to offer fresh readings and provocative frameworks for interpretation. The essays and reflections in Text and Tradition in South India bring together the diverse and foundational contributions made by Narayana Rao to the rewriting of Indias cultural and literary history.

Indian secularism : a social and intellectual history 1890-1950,"Tejani, Shabnum","Many of the central issues in modern Indian politics have long been understood in terms of an opposition between ideologies of secularism and communalism. Observers have argued that recent Hindu nationalism is the symptom of a crisis of Indian secularism and have blamed this on a resurgence of religion or communalism. Shabnum Tejani unpacks prevailing assumptions about the meaning of secularism in contemporary politics, focusing on India but with many points of comparison elsewhere in the world. She questions the simple dichotomy between secularism and communalism that has been used in scholarly study and political discourse.

One of the most important scholars in India during the first half of the twentieth century, Sarkar was knighted in 1929 and is still the only Indian historian to have ever been elected an Honorary Fellow of the American Historical Association. He was a universalizing and scientific historian, highly influential during much of his career, but, by the end of his lifetime, he became marginalized by the history establishment in India. History, Chakrabarty writes, sometimes plays truant with historians: by the 1970swhen Chakrabarty himself was a novice historianSarkar was almost completely forgotten. Through Sarkar s story, Chakrabarty explores the role of historical scholarship in India s colonial modernity and throws new light on the ways that postcolonial Indian historians embraced a more partisan idea of truth in the name of democratic and anti-colonial politics."""

Pax Gandhiana : the political philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi,"Parel, Anthony J.","Notwithstanding his contributions to religion, nonviolence, civil rights, and civil disobedience, among other areas, Gandhi's most significant contribution is that as a political philosopher. While he is not often treated as such, Gandhi was, as Anthony J. Parel argues, a political philosopher sui generis, both in his philosophical method of constant self-criticism and his framework of philosophical analysis. Gandhi wrote daily on politics, but he did so as an activist; political philosophy was to him not just a way of understanding truths of political phenomena but was directly related to understanding those truths in action. If realized in action these truths would give rise to new political institutions, which in turn would create a corresponding peaceful political and social order. Parel dubs this order Pax Gandhiana. The main contention of Pax Gandhiana is that peace cannot be achieved by politics alone. Peace requires the confluence of the canonical ends of life: politics and economics (artha), ethics (dharma), forms of pleasure (kama), and the pursuit of spiritual transcendence (moksha). Modern political philosophy isolates politics from the other three ends, but Gandhi's originality, according to Parel, lies in the way that he brings all four together. In fact Gandhi's political philosophy is relevant not only to India but also to the rest of the world: it is a new type of sovereignty that harmonizes the interest of individual states with the community of states. Arguing against scholars who dispute a theoretical unity in Gandhi's writings, Parel suggests that Gandhi is the preeminent non-western political philosopher, and in this book he seeks to identify the conceptual framework of Gandhi's political philosophy, the Pax Gandhiana."

After Amnesia: Tradition and change in Indian Literary Criticism,"Devy, G. N.","After Amnesia is an original analysis of literary criticism in India. It is an attempt to describe what is recognised by common agreement to be a crisis in Indian criticism, and to explain it in historical terms. Dr Devy argues that the colonial experience in India gave rise to false images of the West as a superior culture; and induced a state of cultural amnesia and mistaken modes of literary criticism. It is this amnesia that is responsible for the belief among literary historians that the critical tradition in the modern Indian languages for instance, Gujarati and Marathi is only over a hundred years old. The author argues that it is inconceivable for these languages to have produced great literatures for half a millennium without developing some form of literary criticism. Therefore, he says, it is necessary to postulate a more reliable literary history."
Document Raj : writing and scribes in early colonial south India,"Raman, Bhavani","Historians of British colonial rule in India have noted both the place of military might and the imposition of new cultural categories in the making of Empire, but Bhavani Raman, in Document Raj, uncovers a lesser-known story of power: the power of bureaucracy. Drawing on extensive archival research in the files of the East India Company’s administrative offices in Madras, she tells the story of a bureaucracy gone awry in a fever of documentation practices that grew ever more abstract—and the power, both economic and cultural, this created. In order to assert its legitimacy and value within the British Empire, the East India Company was diligent about record keeping. Raman shows, however, that the sheer volume of their document production allowed colonial managers to subtly but substantively manipulate records for their own ends, increasingly drawing the real and the recorded further apart. While this administrative sleight of hand increased the company’s reach and power within the Empire, it also bolstered profoundly new orientations to language, writing, memory, and pedagogy for the officers and Indian subordinates involved. Immersed in a subterranean world of delinquent scribes, translators, village accountants, and entrepreneurial fixers, Document Raj maps the shifting boundaries of the legible and illegible, the legal and illegitimate, that would usher India into the modern world."

Walls of Delhi,"Prakash, Uday","A sweeper discovers a cache of black money and escapes to see the Taj Mahal with his underage mistress. An untouchable races to reclaim his life stolen by an upper-caste identity thief. A slum baby's head gets bigger and bigger as he gets smarter and smarter, while his family tries to find a cure. In The Walls of Delhi, gifted storyteller Uday Prakash tells three stinging and comic tales of living and surviving in today's globalized India. Prakash is one of India's most original and audacious writers, and the India that he presents in his fiction is much different from what one generally finds in English-language writing by South Asian writers. Prakash portrays the realities about caste and class, and there is a charming and compelling authenticity in his stories that is sometimes absent from other fiction about South Asia. This writing sits at the center of a modernist aesthetic, as well as being highly political without a bit of didacticism or other heavy-handedness. These stories are tremendously popular in India, having been translated into several Indian languages."

Even critics of Indian society still underwrite such claims. But how well does the “Idea of India” correspond to the realities of the Union? In an iconoclastic intervention, Marxist historian Perry Anderson provides an unforgettable reading of the Subcontinent’s passage through Independence and the catastrophe of Partition, the idiosyncratic and corrosive vanities of Gandhi and Nehru, and the close interrelationship of Indian democracy and caste inequality. The Indian Ideology caused uproar on first publication in 2012, not least for breaking with euphemisms for Delhi’s occupation of Kashmir.

Third pillar : how markets and the state leave the community behind,"Rajan, Raghuram G.","Revised and updated Shortlisted for the Financial Times/McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award From one of the most important economic thinkers of our time, a brilliant and far-seeing analysis of the current populist backlash against globalization. Raghuram Rajan, distinguished University of Chicago professor, former IMF chief economist, head of India's central bank, and author of the 2010 FT-Goldman-Sachs Book of the Year Fault Lines, has an unparalleled vantage point onto the social and economic consequences of globalization and their ultimate effect on our politics. In The Third Pillar he offers up a magnificent big-picture framework for understanding how these three forces--the state, markets, and our communities--interact, why things begin to break down, and how we can find our way back to a more secure and stable plane. The ""third pillar"" of the title is the community we live in. Economists all too often understand their field as the relationship between markets and the state, and they leave squishy social issues for other people. That's not just myopic, Rajan argues; it's dangerous. All economics is actually socioeconomics - all markets are embedded in a web of human relations, values and norms. As he shows, throughout history, technological phase shifts have ripped the market out of those old webs and led to violent backlashes, and to what we now call populism. Eventually, a new equilibrium is reached, but it can be ugly and messy, especially if done wrong. Right now, we're doing it wrong. As markets scale up, the state scales up with it, concentrating economic and political power in flourishing central hubs and leaving the periphery to decompose, figuratively and even literally. Instead, Rajan offers a way to rethink the relationship between the market and civil society and argues for a return to strengthening and empowering local communities as an antidote to growing despair and unrest. Rajan is not a doctrinaire conservative, so his ultimate argument that decision-making has to be devolved to the grass roots or our democracy will continue to wither, is sure to be provocative. But even setting aside its solutions, The Third Pillar is a masterpiece of explication, a book that will be a classic of its kind for its offering of a wise, authoritative and humane explanation of the forces that have wrought such a sea change in our lives."

Oppressive present : literature and social consciousness in colonial India,"Chandra, Sudhir","Marking a departure from studies on history and literature in colonial India, The Oppressive Present explores the emergence of social consciousness as a result of and in response to the colonial mediation in the late nineteenth century. In focusing on contemporary literature in Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, and Marathi, it charts an epochal change in the gradual loss of the old pre-colonial self and the configuration of a new, colonized self. It reveals that the ‘oppressive present’ of generations of subjugated Indians remains so for their freed descendants: the consciousness of those colonized generations continues to characterize the ‘modern educated Indian’. The book proposes ambivalence rather than binary categories — such as communalism and nationalism, communalism and secularism, modernity and tradition — as key to understanding the making of this consciousness. This cross-disciplinary volume will prove essential to scholars and students of modern and contemporary Indian history and society, comparative literature and post-colonial studies."
Great agrarian conquest : the colonial reshaping of a rural world,"Bhattacharya, Neeladri","Groundbreaking analysis of how colonialism created new conceptual categories and spatial forms that reshaped rural societies. This book examines how, over colonial times, the diverse practices and customs of an existing rural universe—with its many forms of livelihood—were reshaped to create a new agrarian world of settled farming. While focusing on Punjab, India, this pathbreaking analysis offers a broad argument about the workings of colonial power: the fantasy of imperialism, it says, is to make the universe afresh. Such radical change, Neeladri Bhattacharya shows, is as much conceptual as material. Agrarian colonization was a process of creating spaces that conformed to the demands of colonial rule. It entailed establishing a regime of categories—tenancies, tenures, properties, habitations—and a framework of laws that made the change possible. Agrarian colonization was in this sense a deep conquest. Colonialism, the book suggests, has the power to revisualize and reorder social relations and bonds of community. It alters the world radically, even when it seeks to preserve elements of the old. The changes it brings about are simultaneously cultural, discursive, legal, linguistic, spatial, social, and economic. Moving from intent to action, concepts to practices, legal enactments to court battles, official discourses to folklore, this book explores the conflicted and dialogic nature of a transformative process. By analyzing this great conquest, and the often silent ways in which it unfolds, the book asks every historian to rethink the practice of writing agrarian history and reflect on the larger issues of doing history. “The Great Agrarian Conquest is a subtle and substantial work of scholarship. If there is one book Indians need to read to understand how colonialism actually worked (or did not work), this is it.” — Ramachandra Guha, in The Wire, in praise of the Indian edition"

Routledge handbook of Indian politics,"Kohli, Atul","India’s growing economic and socio-political importance on the global stage has triggered an increased interest in the country. This Handbook is a reference guide, which surveys the current state of Indian politics and provides a basic understanding of the ways in which the world’s largest democracy functions. The Handbook is structured around four main topics: political change, political economy, the diversity of regional development, and the changing role of India in the world. Chapters examine how and why democracy in India put down firm roots, but also why the quality of governance offered by India’s democracy continues to be low. The acceleration of economic growth since the mid-1980s is discussed, and the Handbook goes on to look at the political and economic changes in selected states, and how progress across Indian states continues to be uneven. It concludes by touching on the issue of India’s international relations, both in South Asia and the wider world. The Handbook offers an invigorating initiation into the seemingly daunting and complex terrain of Indian politics. It is an invaluable resource for academics, researchers, policy analysts, graduate and undergraduate students studying Indian politics."

"Mathematics of India : concepts, methods, connections","Divakaran, P. P.","This book identifies three of the exceptionally fruitful periods of the millennia-long history of the mathematical tradition of India: the very beginning of that tradition in the construction of the now-universal system of decimal numeration and of a framework for planar geometry; a classical period inaugurated by Aryabhata’s invention of trigonometry and his enunciation of the principles of discrete calculus as applied to trigonometric functions; and a final phase that produced, in the work of Madhava, a rigorous infinitesimal calculus of such functions. The main highlight of this book is a detailed examination of these critical phases and their interconnectedness, primarily in mathematical terms but also in relation to their intellectual, cultural and historical contexts. Recent decades have seen a renewal of interest in this history, as manifested in the publication of an increasing number of critical editions and translations of texts, as well as in an informed analytic interpretation of their content by the scholarly community. The result has been the emergence of a more accurate and balanced view of the subject, and the book has attempted to take an account of these nascent insights. As part of an endeavour to promote the new awareness, a special attention has been given to the presentation of proofs of all significant propositions in modern terminology and notation, either directly transcribed from the original texts or by collecting together material from several texts."

Desertification and land degradation atlas of selected districts of India (based on IRS LISS III data of 2011-13 and 2003-05),,"This book discusses land degradation in India using statistical tools such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Regression Analysis (RA), and uses statistical analyses and graphical representations of the causal relationship between land degradation and land productivity to determine linkages with deforestation, climate change and agricultural productivity. While most studies of land degradation in India focus on economic outcomes and physical processes at macro and micro levels, this study addresses land degradation at the meso-level to fill in this gap and provide up-to-date information on often overlooked factors associated with land degradation issues using the latest available data. Districts in the study were selected by land degradation intensity, forming an index of the severity of land degradation in the area, with a focus on gullied lands, soil salinity/alkalinity and open and dense scrubs as indicators. Though the study areas are in India, researchers, policy makers and students around the world will be able to learn from these inputs regarding land degradation to address various challenges associated with sustainable land management and agricultural productivity."

"History and collective memory in South Asia, 1200-2000","Guha, Sumit","In this far-ranging and erudite exploration of the South Asian past, Sumit Guha discusses the shaping of social and historical memory in world-historical context. He presents memory as the result of both remembering and forgetting and of the preservation, recovery, and decay of records. By describing how these processes work through sociopolitical organizations, Guha delineates the historiographic legacy acquired by the British in colonial India; the creation of the centralized educational system and mass production of textbooks that led to unification of historical discourses under colonial auspices; and the divergence of these discourses in the twentieth century under the impact of nationalism and decolonization. Guha brings together sources from a range of languages and regions to provide the first intellectual history of the ways in which socially recognized historical memory has been made across the subcontinent. This thoughtful study contributes to debates beyond the field of history that complicate the understanding of objectivity and documentation in a seemingly post-truth world."

Great economic thinkers,,"Great Economic Thinkers presents an accessible introduction to the lives and works of thirteen of the most influential economists of modern times: Adam Smith, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, Alfred Marshall, Joseph Schumpeter, John Maynard Keynes, and Nobel Prize winners Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, John Forbes Nash, Jr., Daniel Kahneman, Amartya Sen, and Joseph Stiglitz. Free from confusing jargon and equations, the book describes key concepts put forward by these thinkers and shows how they have come to shape how we see ourselves and our society. Readers will consider the role played by the division of labor, wages and rents, cognitive biases, saving, entrepreneurship, game theory, liberalism, laissez-faire, and welfare economics. All of the economists featured have had a profound influence on our attitudes towards market intervention and regulation, taxation, trade, and monetary policy. Each of the chapters—all written by an acknowledged expert—combines a biographical outline of a single thinker with critical analysis of their contribution to economic thought. If you’ve ever wanted to find out more about the theorists who gave us the invisible hand, Marxism, Keynesianism, creative destruction, behavioral economics, and many other foundational concepts of economics, this collection of essays is the perfect place to start."

Loserthink,"Adams, Scott","From the creator of Dilbert and author of Win Bigly, a guide to spotting and avoiding loserthink: sneaky mental habits trapping victims in their own bubbles of reality. If you've been on social media lately, or turned on your TV, you may have noticed a lot of dumb ideas floating around. ""We know when history will repeat and when it won't."" ""We can tell the difference between evidence and coincidences."" ""The simplest explanation is usually true."" Wrong, wrong, and dangerous! If we're not careful, loserthink would have us believe that every Trump supporter is a bigoted racist, addicts should be responsible for fixing the opioid epidemic, and that your relationship fell apart simply because you chewed with your mouth open. Even the smartest people can slip into loserthink's seductive grasp. This book will teach you how to spot and avoid it--and will give you scripts to respond when hollow arguments are being brandished against you, whether by well-intentioned friends, strangers on the internet, or political pundits. You'll also learn how to spot the underlying causes of loserthink, like the inability to get ego out of your decisions, thinking with words instead of reasons, failing to imagine alternative explanations, and making too much of coincidences. Your bubble of reality doesn't have to be a prison. This book will show you how to break free--and, what's more, to be among the most perceptive and respected thinkers in every conversation."

Those magnificent women and their flying machines,"Vaid, Minnie","A fascinating look into the lives, struggles and triumphs of the women scientists who spearheaded Mangalyaan--India's mission to Mars. In late 2013, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) launched Mangalyaan--India's first inter-planetary mission--after just eighteen months, at a fraction of the cost of similar missions by foreign space agencies. The next year India became the first Asian nation to reach the Mars orbit and the first in the world to do so in its first attempt. This historic mission, among ISRO's other great successes, was spearheaded by the most talented, dedicated and badass group of women scientists that the world has ever seen. Nandini Harinath and Ritu Karidhal calculated the spacecraft's trajectory to Mars, besides overseeing the mission operations; Moumita Dutta and Minal Sampat designed the complex scientific instruments involved in the mission; while numerous other 'Wonder Women' have been instrumental in ISRO's other pathbreaking work. Those Magnificent Women and Their Flying Machines narrates the inspiring stories of these extraordinary women: how they overcame the naysayers and gender barriers in a field dominated by men to achieve the impossible. Now India is ready to launch Gaganyaan, its first space mission with humans on board, at least one of whom will be a woman. Women in science are set to reach for the stars--and beyond."
Tikli and laxmi bomb,"Kripalani, Aditya","Two sex workers, Putul (Tikli), 22 and Laxmi, 40, decide to form a co-operative of their own and create a system of sex workers which is run by and for the women themselves. An anit-patriarchy story that takes on patriarchy at its very root. ""A Thelma and Louise-like vibe enters the narrative from the moment Tikli's first ill-advised outburst lands the pair into a spot of bother. Character development is the author's strong suite and it is obvious that he has carried Tikli and Laxmi inside his head for years. Laxmi, in particular, leaps off the pages, especially at the junctions like the first time she threatens a man with violence and all-important where the co-operative (or ""our system"", as Tikli and Laxmi call it) has its first physical confrontation with Mhatre's goons... ...Tikli and Laxmi Bomb is neither with fulfillment, feel-good literature nor a violence-fuelled revange story, although it flits briefly with the notion of being both. Thankfully, it sticks to what it is at heart: a gripping, no-hold-barred realist novel. ...it is rare to see genre fiction of this calibre coming out of India. ...Tikli and Laxmi Bomb, then, completes a formidible, intensively cinematic troika for Kripalani.

Saying no to jugaad : the making of Bigbasket,"Hari, T. N.","Saying No to Jugaad is a riveting account of how the start-up ecosystem in India evolved rapidly in the last 10 years. Ushering in a new turn in the country's economy that shook up existing ways of doing business, start-ups brought together investors and a rare breed of entrepreneurs to create a set of unicorns focused, for the first time, on solving the country's problems. The book busts some of the common myths around e-commerce businesses and describes the evolution of grocery as the mother of all categories in this sector. It also is the story of how start-ups go through different distinct stages as they evolve and mature. The courage needed to hold your ground when the world seems to have a contrarian view, the relentless focus on customer centricity and the emphasis on foundation-building are illustrated through lucid and stirring stories. Entertaining and anecdotal, the book is not a panegyric about the founders or the company but is the story of real people and a real company with real flaws but also several great ideas and moments. Saying No to Jugaad vividly captures the vision, culture and commitment to values which has made Bigbasket one of India's most successful start-ups."

Optimization : theory and practice,"Joshi, Mohan C.","""In general, this presentation demonstrates the interrelationships between the various facets of optimization. These aspects range from the differential calculus through direct search and mathematical programming techniques to the more specialized game theory and decision theory required when competition is present. The integrated approach is seen, for instance, in the discussion of multidimensional numerical search techniques . Each search may be characterized by the two essential features of a distance and direction of movement. These, together with a further classification based on whether or not the gradient is required, have provided the framework within which search methods are presented. In this context the similarities and differences, the advantages and disadvantages, and the range of applicabilities and failures of all search techniques can be clearly understood. Thus such well-known search methods as Rosen's gradient projection and Zoutendijk's feasible directions are seen to stem from the same basic concept, namely, local linearization. A second example of the interrelationship of methods is the evolution from the Lagrangian formulation of such diverse techniques as the so-called discrete maximum principle, the maximum principle of Pontryagin, duals in linear problems, the Kuhn-Tucker conditions, steepest ascent, the gradient projection, and other important techniques.""--Preface."

Animal intimacies : interspecies relatedness in India's Central Himalayas,"Govindrajan, Radhika","""A delightful read [and] an important addition to human-animal relations studies."" — Anthropology Matters What does it mean to live and die in relation to other animals? Animal Intimacies posits this central question alongside the intimate—and intense—moments of care, kinship, violence, politics, indifference, and desire that occur between human and non-human animals. Built on extensive ethnographic fieldwork in the mountain villages of India's Central Himalayas, Radhika Govindrajan's book explores the number of ways that human and animal interact to cultivate relationships as interconnected, related beings. Whether it is through the study of the affect and ethics of ritual animal sacrifice, analysis of the right-wing political project of cow-protection, or examination of villagers' talk about bears who abduct women and have sex with them, Govindrajan illustrates that multispecies relatedness relies on both difference and ineffable affinity between animals. Animal Intimacies breaks substantial new ground in animal studies, and Govindrajan's detailed portrait of the social, political and religious life of the region will be of interest to cultural anthropologists and scholars of South Asia as well.

"Tatas, Freddie Mercury and other Bawas : an intimate history of Parsis","Kapoor, Coomi","The Parsis are fast disappearing. There are now only around 50,000 members of the community in all of India. But since their arrival here from Central Asia, somewhere between the eighth and tenth centuries, the Parsis' contribution to their adopted home has been extraordinary. The history of India over the last century or so is filigreed with such contributions in every field, from nuclear physics to rock and roll, by names such as Dadabhai Naoroji, Dinshaw Petit, Homi Bhabha, Sam Manekshaw, Jamsetji Tata, Ardeshir Godrej, Cyrus Poonawalla, Zubin Mehta and Farrokh Bulsara (aka Freddie Mercury). This is a revised and updated new edition - engaging and accessible - making it as the most intimate history of the Parsis by senior journalist and columnist Coomi Kapoor, herself a Parsi. The book pores through the names, stories, achievements and the continuing success of this tiny but extraordinary minority. She delves deep into both the question of what it means to be Parsi in India, as well as how the community's contributions-from tanchoi silk to chikoos-became integral to what it meant to be Indian. In Kapoor's hands, the story of the Parsis becomes a rip-roaring, incident-filled adventure: from dominating the trade with China to being synonymous with Bombay, once, arguably, a city defined by its Parsis; from the business success of the Tatas, the Mistrys, the Godrejs and the Wadias, to such current contributions as the manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines by the Parsi-founded Serum Institute of India."

From the vitalist urban plans of the Scottish polymath Patrick Geddes in India to the Theosophical Society in Madras and the ways in which it provided a context for a novel South Indian garden design; from the visual, textual, and ritual designs of Californian Vedanta from the 1930s to the present; to the spatial transformations associated with post-1990s highways and rapid transit systems in Bangalore that are shaping an emerging “Indian New Age” of religious and somatic self-styling, Srinivas tells the story of contrapuntal histories, the contiguity of lives, and resonances between utopian worlds that are generative of designs for cultural alternatives and futures."

It roamed beneath the ocean breathing fire . . . ' When he wakes up, Elango knows his life has changed. His dream will consume him until he gives it shape. The potter must create a terracotta horse whose beauty will be reason enough for its existence. Yet he cannot pin down from where it has galloped into his mind – the Mahabharata, or Trojan legend, or his anonymous potter-ancestors. Nor can he say where it belongs – in a temple compound, within a hotel lobby, or with Zohra, whom he despairs of ever marrying. The astral, indefinable force driving Elango towards forbidden love and creation has unleashed other currents. A neighbourhood girl begins her bewildering journey into adulthood, developing a complicated relationship with him. A lost dog adopts him, taking over his heart. Meanwhile, his community is driven by inflammatory passions of a different kind. Here, people, animals, and even the gods live on a knife's edge and the consequences of daring to dream against the tide are cataclysmic. Moving between India and England, The Earthspinner reflects the many ways in which the East encounters the West. It breathes new life into ancient myths, giving allegorical shape to the war of fanaticism against reason and the imagination. It is an intricate, wrenching novel about the changed ways of loving and living in the modern world."
"Beyond caste : identity and power in South Asia, past and present","Guha, Sumit",'Caste' is today almost universally perceived as an ancient and unchanging Hindu institution preserved solely by a deep-seated religious ideology. Yet the word itself is an importation from sixteenth-century Europe. This book tracks the long history of the practices amalgamated under this label and shows their connection to changing patterns of social and political power down to the present. It frames caste as an involuted and complex form of ethnicity and explains why it persisted under non-Hindu rulers and in non-Hindu communities across South Asia.

Introduction to critical theory : Horkheimer to Habermas,"Held, David","The writings of the Frankfurt school, in particular of Horkheimer, Adorno, Marcuse, and Jurgen Habermas, caught the imagination of the radical movements of the 1960s and 1970s and became a key element in the Marxism of the New Left. Partly due to their rise to prominence during the political turmoil of the 1960s, the work of these critical theorists has been the subject of continuing controversy in both political and academic circles. However, their ideas are frequently misunderstood. In this major work, now available from Polity Press, David Held presents a much-needed introduction to, and evaluation of, critical theory. Some of the major themes he considers are critical theory's relation to Marx's critique of political economy, Freudian psychoanalysis, aesthetics and the philosophy of history. There is also an extended discussion of critical theory's substantive contribution to the analysis of capitalism, culture, the family, the individual, as well as its contribution to epistemology and methodology."

She wrote among literary giants who were mostly men, but carved a singular space for herself with her unflinching gaze at the hypocrisy of a society that claims to venerate women yet balks at giving them the keys to their shackles. These 18 stories are representative of her wonderful insights into the inner life of women – her characters span the spectrum from rural to urban, illiterate to educated, homemakers to career professionals. Through all the stories runs a vein of gentle mockery – the inimitable Mannu Bhandari style."

Arzu,"Razdan, Riva","It became the summer that Arzu gained and lost everything that girlhood had set her up for. It is 1991, and India's economy is opening up to foreign investment for the very first time. For wealthy business families across the country, however, it is a move fraught with uncertainty. In Bombay, Arzu, the pampered daughter of a newspaper mogul, finds the situation particularly tense. Her one concern is to score a proposal from her millionaire boyfriend before the country's celebrated liberalization sours his mood any further. Then, an innocent gesture on her part causes all her plans to go awry, and Arzu escapes to New York City with her snobby aunt Parul on the pretext of attending finishing school. While Parul Bua's one-point agenda is to find her a suitable match, Arzu, revelling in the heady independence that New York offers, finds herself poised on the brink of an idea that could change the nature of an entire industry back home. Now, even as Arzu negotiates catty debutante-ball drama and evades the charms of her father's smug protégé, she must prove her worth to investors so as to silence her critics. The question remains, can someone who has always played second fiddle to the men in her life discover how to become the heroine of her own story?"

Advanced linear algebra,"Loehr, Nicholas","Designed for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students in linear or abstract algebra, Advanced Linear Algebra covers theoretical aspects of the subject, along with examples, computations, and proofs. It explores a variety of advanced topics in linear algebra that highlight the rich interconnections of the subject to geometry, algebra, analysis, combinatorics, numerical computation, and many other areas of mathematics. The book’s 20 chapters are grouped into six main areas: algebraic structures, matrices, structured matrices, geometric aspects of linear algebra, modules, and multilinear algebra. The level of abstraction gradually increases as students proceed through the text, moving from matrices to vector spaces to modules. Each chapter consists of a mathematical vignette devoted to the development of one specific topic. Some chapters look at introductory material from a sophisticated or abstract viewpoint while others provide elementary expositions of more theoretical concepts. Several chapters offer unusual perspectives or novel treatments of standard results. Unlike similar advanced mathematical texts, this one minimizes the dependence of each chapter on material found in previous chapters so that students may immediately turn to the relevant chapter without first wading through pages of earlier material to access the necessary algebraic background and theorems. Chapter summaries contain a structured list of the principal definitions and results. End-of-chapter exercises aid students in digesting the material. Students are encouraged to use a computer algebra system to help solve computationally intensive exercises."

Assuming relatively little mathematical background, it is ideal for beginning graduate students or advanced undergraduates learning category theory for the first time. For each new categorical concept, a generous supply of examples is provided, taken from different parts of mathematics. At points where the leap in abstraction is particularly great (such as the Yoneda lemma), the reader will find careful and extensive explanations. Copious exercises are included."
Culture and Imperialism,"Said, Edward W.","A landmark work from the author of Orientalism that explores the long-overlooked connections between the Western imperial endeavor and the culture that both reflected and reinforced it. ""Grandly conceived . . . urgently written and urgently needed. . . . No one studying the relations between the metropolitan West and the decolonizing world can ignore Mr. Said's work.' --The New York Times Book Review In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as the Western powers built empires that stretched from Australia to the West Indies, Western artists created masterpieces ranging from Mansfield Park to Heart of Darkness and Aida. Yet most cultural critics continue to see these phenomena as separate. Edward Said looks at these works alongside those of such writers as W. B. Yeats, Chinua Achebe, and Salman Rushdie to show how subject peoples produced their own vigorous cultures of opposition and resistance. Vast in scope and stunning in its erudition, Culture and Imperialism reopens the dialogue between literature and the life of its time."

Everything is f*cked : a book about hope,"Manson, Mark","New York Times Bestseller “Just because everything appears to be a mess doesn’t mean you have to be one. Mark Manson’s book is a call to arms for a better life and better world and could not be more needed right now.” — Ryan Holiday, bestselling author of The Obstacle is the Way and Ego is the Enemy From the author of the international mega-bestseller The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck comes a counterintuitive guide to the problems of hope. We live in an interesting time. Materially, everything is the best it’s ever been—we are freer, healthier and wealthier than any people in human history. Yet, somehow everything seems to be irreparably and horribly f*cked—the planet is warming, governments are failing, economies are collapsing, and everyone is perpetually offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we have access to technology, education and communication our ancestors couldn’t even dream of, so many of us come back to an overriding feeling of hopelessness. What’s going on? If anyone can put a name to our current malaise and help fix it, it’s Mark Manson. In 2016, Manson published The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, a book that brilliantly gave shape to the ever-present, low-level hum of anxiety that permeates modern living. He showed us that technology had made it too easy to care about the wrong things, that our culture had convinced us that the world owed us something when it didn’t—and worst of all, that our modern and maddening urge to always find happiness only served to make us unhappier. Instead, the “subtle art” of that title turned out to be a bold challenge: to choose your struggle; to narrow and focus and find the pain you want to sustain. The result was a book that became an international phenomenon, selling millions of copies worldwide while becoming the #1 bestseller in 13 different countries. In Everthing Is F*cked, Manson turns his gaze from the inevitable flaws within each individual self to the endless calamities taking place in the world around us. Drawing from the pool of psychological research on these topics, as well as the timeless wisdom of philosophers such as Plato, Nietzsche, and Tom Waits, he dissects religion and politics and the uncomfortable ways they have come to resemble one another. He looks at our relationships with money, entertainment and the internet, and how too much of a good thing can psychologically eat us alive. He openly defies our definitions of faith, happiness, freedom—and even of hope itself. With his usual mix of erudition and where-the-f*ck-did-that-come-from humor, Manson takes us by the collar and challenges us to be more honest with ourselves and connected with the world in ways we probably haven’t considered before. It’s another counterintuitive romp through the pain in our hearts and the stress of our soul. One of the great modern writers has produced another book that will set the agenda for years to come."

""[These] novels are a spectacular explosion of history set off within the lives of a dozen or so Britons and Indians on the edges of vast change . . . If you want to know where the political world we now live in began, Paul Scott's novels are a place to start."" — The New York Times Book Review ""A rich novel of manners . . . Politics, cultism, police and military interrogation—all moving toward inevitable murder and violence—are integral parts of a carefully crafted, complex novel."" — Library Journal"

Feynman lectures on computation,"Feynman, Richard P.","The last lecture course that Nobel Prize winner Richard P. Feynman gave to students at Caltech from 1983 to 1986 was not on physics but on computer science. The first edition of the Feynman Lectures on Computation, published in 1996, provided an overview of standard and not-so-standard topics in computer science given in Feynman’s inimitable style. Although now over 20 years old, most of the material is still relevant and interesting, and Feynman’s unique philosophy of learning and discovery shines through. For this new edition, Tony Hey has updated the lectures with an invited chapter from Professor John Preskill on “Quantum Computing 40 Years Later”. This contribution captures the progress made toward building a quantum computer since Feynman’s original suggestions in 1981. The last 25 years have also seen the “Moore’s law” roadmap for the IT industry coming to an end. To reflect this transition, John Shalf, Senior Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, has contributed a chapter on “The Future of Computing beyond Moore’s Law”. The final update for this edition is an attempt to capture Feynman’s interest in artificial intelligence and artificial neural networks. Eric Mjolsness, now a Professor of Computer Science at the University of California Irvine, was a Teaching Assistant for Feynman’s original lecture course and his research interests are now the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning for multi-scale science. He has contributed a chapter called “Feynman on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning” that captures the early discussions with Feynman and also looks toward future developments. This exciting and important work provides key reading for students and scholars in the fields of computer science and computational physics."

In free fall : my experiments with living,"Sarabhai, Mallika","Description In this frank portrayal of her extraordinary life, Mallika doesn't hold back in talking about her 'thirty-year obsession with being thin'; her addictions like smoking and how she 'hypnotised' her way out of it; her fascination with alternate therapies like Pranik healing, Ayurveda and colour therapy, and the beauty treatments she uses for 'future-proofing' her body so that she can continue to dance and perform for years to come. She speaks with equal candour about her battles with grief and depression- when she lost her beloved father, the space scientist Vikram Sarabhai, in 1971; a painful break-up with a man she loved; and her ups and downs with her children, due, in part, to her own relationships. The loss of her mother, dancer Mrinalini Sarabhai, in 2016, left her bereft; yoga, dance, transcendental meditation and NVC-Non-violent Communication-were some of the ways that she coped. Laced with humour and an earthy wisdom, In Free Fall is all about coming to terms with yourself and your body and finding the lifestyle that works for you. And how to make mistakes, pick yourself up and carry on. Never preachy, this 'self-help' memoir delivers an immensely useful message for anyone who wants good health-and happiness"

Brief history of neoliberalism,"Harvey, David","Neoliberalism - the doctrine that market exchange is an ethic in itself, capable of acting as a guide for all human action - has become dominant in both thought and practice throughout much of the world since 1970 or so. Its spread has depended upon a reconstitution of state powers such that privatization, finance, and market processes are emphasized. State interventions in the economy are minimized, while the obligations of the state to provide for the welfare of its citizens are diminished. David Harvey, author of 'The New Imperialism' and 'The Condition of Postmodernity', here tells the political-economic story of where neoliberalization came from and how it proliferated on the world stage. While Thatcher and Reagan are often cited as primary authors of this neoliberal turn, Harvey shows how a complex of forces, from Chile to China and from New York City to Mexico City, have also played their part. In addition he explores the continuities and contrasts between neoliberalism of the Clinton sort and the recent turn towards neoconservative imperialism of George W. Bush. Finally, through critical engagement with this history, Harvey constructs a framework not only for analyzing the political and economic dangers that now surround us, but also for assessing the prospects for the more socially just alternatives being advocated by many oppositional movements."

Freud political and social thought,"Roazen, Paul","Sigmund Freud had broad ambitions about what psychoanalysis could add to human thought. But Freutfs own writings have rarely been assessed within the perspective of political philosophy. Political theorists will find in the school Freud established a rich storehouse of ideas. For us to link up with what Freud was saying means to join in the great conversation about what the ends of the just society should be, as well as what a fully developed person might be like. Written more than twenty years ago, the central interpretive theses found in ""Freud: Political and Social Thought ""still ring true. In his new introduction to this classic text, Paul Roazen contends that today, from the point of view of intellectual history, Freud looms as a subject in an even larger way than he did back in the 1960s. His thinking has impinged, for good or ill, on how we think about character and the nature of human impulses. Privacy itself has been affected, so much so that political candidates now feel free to use intimate material from private life for manipulative public purposes. Yet after all this time political scientists remain reluctant to entertain the need to explore the psychological dimension of all political events. Without reducing politics to psychoanalysis, or inflating psychological categories to embrace all of politics, Roazen provides an introductory look at the field of psychoanalysis. By bringing together the different disciplines of psychology and politics he breaks through parochialism. Roazen is no advocate for psychoanalysis, but believes that analysts have as much to learn from social science as the other way around. This volume is proof that at its best political theory has to be inherently interdisciplinary. As such, this volume will be of interest to intellectual historians, psychoanalysts, and political theorists."
Gandhi and liberalism : satyagraha and the conquest of evil,"Haksar, Vinit","One of the main themes running through Gandhi’s life and work was the battle against evil. This book offers a fascinating reconstruction of Gandhi and the doctrine of Ahimsa or non-violence. Gandhi’s moral perfectionism is contrasted with other forms of perfectionism, but the book stresses that Gandhi also offered a doctrine of the second best. Following Gandhi, the author argues that outward violence with compassion is intrinsically not as good as non-violence with compassion, but it is a second best that is sometimes a necessary evil in an imperfect world. The book provides an illuminating analysis of coercion, non-co-operation, civil disobedience and necessary evil, comparing Gandhi’s ideas with that of some of the leading western moral, legal and political philosophers. Further, some of his important ideas are shown to have relevance for the working of the Indian Constitution. This book will be essential for scholars and researchers in moral, legal and political philosophy, Gandhi studies, political science and South Asian studies."

Philosophy of perception : a contemporary introduction,"Fish, William","The philosophy of perception investigates the nature of our sensory experiences and their relation to reality. In the second edition of this popular book, William Fish introduces the subject thematically, setting out the major theories of perception together with their motivations and attendant problems. While providing historical background to debates in the field, this comprehensive overview focuses on recent presentations and defenses of the different theories, and looks beyond visual perception to take into account the role of other senses. The second edition organizes the contents into two main parts: the first deals with philosophical theories of perception, and the second covers key topics and issues in perception as they are discussed in philosophy, cognitive science, and psychology. Two completely new chapters have been added – one on color and color vision; and a second on the interaction between sense modalities – and other chapters have been significantly updated to include discussion of topics such as pre-twentieth-century philosophy of perception, phenomenal intentionality, color adverbialism, predictive processing approaches to perception, ecological approaches to perception, and in-depth discussions of the non-visual senses. Additional updates include fuller and easier-to-understand explanations of some important views that were glossed over in the first edition and greater coverage of research from the last 25 years. All chapter summaries, references, and Suggested Reading lists at the end of each chapter have been brought up to date and the volume now includes a more extensive index at the back of the book.

Superstructuralism : the philosophy of structuralism and post-structuralism,"Harland, Richard","First Published in 2002. It is easy to see that we are living in a time of rapid and radical social change. It is much less easy to grasp the fact that such change will inevitably affect the nature of those disciplines that both reflect our society and help to shape it. Yet this is nowhere more apparent than in the central field of what may, in general terms, be called literary studies. ‘New Accents’ is intended as a positive response to the initiative offered by such a situation. Each volume in the series will seek to encourage rather than resist the process of change. To stretch rather than reinforce the boundaries that currently define literature and its academic study."
Essential Weber : a reader,"Whimster, Sam","Weber is increasingly being recognised as the theorist of modernity. Avoiding the mistakes of other classical thinkers, his sociological analysis has an increasing validity and relevance. Selected by one of the world's leading Weber scholars, this book introduces the work of this key thinker to a new generation of readers. Central themes highlighted in the collection are: * the developmental logic of world religions * the rise of modern capitalism * the multi-dimensionality of power in societies * the dilemmas of modernity * the theory of social action * ideal types and the objectivity of knowledge. The majority of the readings have been specially translated for this collection both to improve accuracy and to make Weber speak anew in the idiom of the twenty-first century. Each part opens with a short introduction explaining the sequence of readings, the flow of ideas and their intellectual context, and concludes with a guide to further reading."

"Idea of Indian literature : gender, genre, and comparative method","Mani, Preetha","Winner of the 2023 Aldo and Jeanne Scaglione Prize for South Asian Studies Indian literature is not a corpus of texts or literary concepts from India, argues Preetha Mani, but a provocation that seeks to resolve the relationship between language and literature, written in as well as against English. Examining canonical Hindi and Tamil short stories from the crucial decades surrounding decolonization, Mani contends that Indian literature must be understood as indeterminate, propositional, and reflective of changing dynamics between local, regional, national, and global readerships. In The Idea of Indian Literature, she explores the paradox that a single canon can be written in multiple languages, each with their own evolving relationships to one another and to English. Hindi, representing national aspirations, and Tamil, epitomizing the secessionist propensities of the region, are conventionally viewed as poles of the multilingual continuum within Indian literature. Mani shows, however, that during the twentieth century, these literatures were coconstitutive of one another and of the idea of Indian literature itself. The writers discussed here—from short-story forefathers Premchand and Pudumaippittan to women trailblazers Mannu Bhandari and R. Chudamani—imagined a pan-Indian literature based on literary, rather than linguistic, norms, even as their aims were profoundly shaped by discussions of belonging unique to regional identity. Tracing representations of gender and the uses of genre in the shifting thematic and aesthetic practices of short vernacular prose writing, the book offers a view of the Indian literary landscape as itself a field for comparative literature."
Theories and narratives : reflections on the philosophy of history,"Callinicos, Alex","Pursuing this objective, Alex Callinicos critically confronts a number of leading attempts to reconceptualize the meaning of history, including Francis Fukuyama's rehabilitation of Hegel's philosophy of history and the postmodernist efforts of Hayden White and others to deny the existence of a past independent of our representations of it. In these cases philosophical arguments are pursued in tandem with discussions of historical interpretations of, respectively, Stalinism and the Holocaust."

Understanding Phenomenology,"Cerbone, David R.","""Understanding Phenomenology"" provides a guide to one of the most important schools of thought in modern philosophy. The book traces phenomenology's historical development, beginning with its founder, Edmund Husserl and his ""pure"" or ""transcendental"" phenomenology, and continuing with the later, ""existential"" phenomenology of Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. The book also assesses later, critical responses to phenomenology - from Derrida to Dennett - as well as the continued significance of phenomenology for philosophy today. Written for anyone coming to phenomenology for the first time, the book guides the reader through the often bewildering array of technical concepts and jargon associated with phenomenology and provides clear explanations and helpful examples to encourage and enhance engagement with the primary texts."
Understanding empiricism,"Meyers, Robert G.","""Understanding Empiricism"" is an introduction to empiricism and the empiricist tradition in philosophy. The book presents empiricism as a philosophical outlook that unites several philosophers and discusses the most important philosophical issues bearing on the subject, while maintaining enough distance from, say, the intricacies of Locke, Berkeley, Hume scholarship to allow students to gain a clear overview of empiricism without being lost in the details of the exegetical disputes surrounding particular philosophers. Written for students the book can serve both as an introduction to current problems in the theory of knowledge as well as a comprehensive survey of the history of empiricist ideas. The book begins by distinguishing between the epistemological and psychological/causal versions of empiricism, showing that it is the former that is of primary interest to philosophers. The next three chapters, on Locke, Berkeley, Hume respectively, provide an introduction to the main protagonists in the British empiricist tradition from this perspective. The book then examines more contemporary material including the ideas of Sellars, foundations and coherence theories, the rejection of the a priori by Mill, Peirce and Quine, scepticism and, finally, the status of religious belief within empiricism. Particular attention is paid to criticisms of empiricism, such as Leibniz's criticisms of Locke on innatism and Frege's objections to Mill on mathematics. The discussions are kept at an introductory level throughout to help students to locate the principles of empiricism in relation to modern philosophy."
Understanding hegelianism,"Sinnerbrink, Robert","""Understanding Hegelianism"" explores the ways in which Hegelian and anti-Hegelian currents of thought have shaped some of the most significant movements in twentieth-century European philosophy, particularly the traditions of critical theory, existentialism, Marxism and poststructuralism. The first part of the book examines Kierkegaard's existentialism and Marx's materialism, which present two defining poles of subsequent Hegelian and anti-Hegelian movements. The second part looks at the contrasting critiques of Hegel by Lukacs and Heidegger, which set the stage for the appropriation of Hegelian themes in German critical theory and the anti-Hegelian turn in French poststructuralism. The role of Hegelian themes in the work of Adorno, Habermas and Honneth are explored. In the third part, the rich tradition of Hegelianism in modern French philosophy is considered - the work of Wahl, Kojeve, Hyppolite, Lefebvre, Sartre, de Beauvoir as well as the radical critique of Hegelianism articulated by Derrida and Deleuze. Although the focus is primarily on German and French appropriations of Hegelian thought, the author also explores some of the recent developments in Anglophone Hegelianism."
Understanding Nietzscheanism,"Woodward, Ashley","Nietzsche's critiques of traditional modes of thinking, valuing and living, as well as his radical proposals for new alternatives, have been vastly influential in a wide variety of areas, such that an understanding of his philosophy and its influence is important for grasping many aspects of contemporary thought and culture. However Nietzsche's thought is complex and elusive, and has been interpreted in many ways. Moreover, he has influenced starkly contrasting movements and schools of thought, from atheism to theology, from existentialism to poststructuralism, and from Nazism to feminism. This book charts Nietzsche's influence, both historically and thematically, across a variety of these contrasting disciplines and schools of interpretation. It provides both an accessible introduction to Nietzsche's thought and its impact and an overview of contemporary approaches to Nietzsche."

Ambedkar's vision of economic development for India,"Sridevi, Gummadi","This book discusses Ambedkar’s engagements with the issues of social justice, economic development and caste enclosures. It highlights his significant contributions in the field of trade, public finance and monetary economics, Indian agriculture, education, among others, and examines their relevance in contemporary India. The volume analyses the basic theoretical conceptions in Ambedkar’s writings which attributed a key role to industrialisation, favoured economic planning and progressive labour laws. It reaffirms these theories and illustrates that focus on social and economic democracy promotes productivity, equitable distribution of wealth and an inclusive society. Through an analysis of Ambedkar’s interdisciplinary works, the book discusses issues of rural poverty, lagging infrastructure growth, the persistence of an exploitative ruling class and the economic and social marginalisation of the downtrodden which are still relevant today. Further, it offers solutions for a restructuring of the society under democratic principles which would recognise the basic right of all to social dignity, and devise means to insure against social and economic insecurity. Insightful and authoritative, this volume will be of great interest to students and researchers of economics, sociology, development studies and social exclusion."
Agamben's joyful Kafka : finding freedom beyond subordination,"Snoek, Anke","Both Giorgio Agamben and Franz Kafka are best known for their gloomy political worldview. A cautious study of Agamben's references on Kafka, however, reveals another dimension right at the intersection of their works: a complex and unorthodox theory of freedom. The inspiration emerges from Agamben's claims that 'it is a very poor reading of Kafka's works that sees in them only a summation of the anguish of a guilty man before the inscrutable power'. Virtually all of Kafka's stories leave us puzzled about what really happened. Was Josef K., who is butchered like a dog, defeated? And what about the meaningless but in his own way complete creature Odradek? Agamben's work sheds new light on these questions and arrives, through Kafka, at different strategies for freedom at the point where this freedom is most blatantly violated."
By the sea,"Gurnah, Abdulrazak","A masterwork by the 2021 Nobel Prize winner in Literature, in which two immigrants’ conflicting stories about their common homeland reveal the buried truths that drove them from it On a late November afternoon, Saleh Omar arrives at Gatwick Airport from his native Zanzibar. With him he has a small bag in which lies his most precious possession—a mahogany box containing incense. He used to own a furniture shop, have a house and be a husband and father. Now he is an asylum seeker from paradise, silence his only protection. Meanwhile, Latif Mahmud, a distinguished young professor, lives quietly alone in his London flat. When the two encounter each other in an English seaside town, the narratives each carries of their mutual past begin to unravel—revealing an infinitely more fascinating story of love and betrayal, seduction and possession, and of a people desperately trying to find stability amidst the maelstrom of their times."

Mai: silently mother,"Shree, Geetanjali","Behind the walls of a house in a North Indian town a whole world thrives—of the joint family, their attendants, their visitors. Three generations of women and their men live different strategies of adjustment and achievement to accommodate or challenge patriarchy. They seem to fit in recognised frames, but what are the subtle machinations behind the apparent stereotypes? It is that which the novel uncovers, in a tale told in deceptively simple terms, using smells, sounds, tastes and flavours, scenes and tiny signs, and incidents of a daily and ordinary existence to build, weave by weave, a rich and layered tapestry, saying always more than is apparent. At the centre is Mai, the mother, seemingly weak and silent, but it is she who holds together the subtle patterns of relationships and agencies, and quietly carves out a life for herself as also for those around. Her New Age children are obsessed with rescuing her from the ‘prison’ and escaping themselves; but as the story unfolds, any simplistic notion of bondage and freedom goes for a toss. Profound stories of love and loss are lightly delivered. Mai was her debut novel which was translated into English by Nita Kumar. This translation received the Sahitya Akademi award and also was shortlisted for the Crossword Book Award in 2001."

Last gift,"Gurnah, Abdulrazak","One day, long before the troubles, he slipped away without saying a word to anyone and never went back. And then another day, forty three years later, he collapsed just inside the front door of his house in a small English town. It was late in the day when it happened, on his way home after work, but it was also late in the day altogether. He had left things for too long and there was no one to blame for it but himself. Abbas has never told anyone about his past - before he was a sailor on the high seas, before he met his wife Maryam outside a Boots in Exeter, before they settled into a quiet life in Norwich with their children, Jamal and Hanna. Now, at the age of sixty-three, he suffers a collapse that renders him bedbound and unable to speak about things he thought he would one day have to. Jamal and Hanna have grown up and gone out into the world. They were both born in England but cannot shake a sense of apartness. Hanna calls herself Anna now, and has just moved to a new city to be near her boyfriend. She feels the relationship is headed somewhere serious, but the words have not yet been spoken out loud. Jamal, the listener of the family, moves into a student house and is captivated by a young woman with dark-blue eyes and her own, complex story to tell. Abbas's illness forces both children home, to the dark silences of their father and the fretful capability of their mother Maryam, who began life as a foundling and has never thought to find herself, until now."
Shortest history of the Soviet Union,"Fitzpatrick, Sheila","In 1917, Bolshevik revolutionaries came to power in the war-torn Russian Empire in a way that defied all predictions, including their own. Scarcely a lifespan later, in 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed as accidentally as it arose. The decades between witnessed drama on an epic scale—the chaos and hope of revolution, famines and purges, hard-won victory in history’s most destructive war, and worldwide geopolitical conflict, all entwined around the dream of building a better society. This book is a lively and authoritative distillation of this complex history, told with vivid details, a grand sweep, and wry wit. The acclaimed historian Sheila Fitzpatrick chronicles the Soviet Age—its rise, reign, and unexpected fall, as well as its afterlife in today’s Russia. She underscores the many ironies of the Soviet experience: An ideology that claimed to offer humanity the reins of history wrangled with contingency. An avowedly internationalist and anti-imperialist state birthed an array of nationalisms. And a vision of transcending economic and social inequality and injustice gave rise to a country that was, in its way, surprisingly normal. Moving seamlessly from Lenin to Stalin to Gorbachev to Putin, The Shortest History of the Soviet Union provides an indispensable guide to one of the twentieth century’s great powers and the enduring fascination it still exerts."
Subaltern Indian Woman : Domination and Social Degradation,"Misir, Prem","This book focuses on subjugated indentured Indian women, who are constantly faced with race, gender, caste, and class oppression and inequality on overseas European-owned plantations, but who are also armed with latent links to the women’s abolition movements in the homeland. Also examining their post-indenture life, it employs a paradigm of male-dominated Indian women in India at the margins of an enduringly patriarchal society, a persisting backdrop to the huge 19th century post-slavery movement of the agricultural indentured workforce drawn largely from India. This book depicts the antithetical and contradictory explanations for the indentured Indian women’s cries, degradation and dehumanization and how the politics of change and control impacted their social organization and its legacy. The book owes its origins to the 2017 centennial commemorative event celebrating 100 years of the abolition of the indenture system of Indian labor that victimized and dehumanized Indians from 1834 through 1917."
Classical and modern optimization,"Carlier, Guillaume","The quest for the optimal is ubiquitous in nature and human behavior. The field of mathematical optimization has a long history and remains active today, particularly in the development of machine learning.Classical and Modern Optimization presents a self-contained overview of classical and modern ideas and methods in approaching optimization problems. The approach is rich and flexible enough to address smooth and non-smooth, convex and non-convex, finite or infinite-dimensional, static or dynamic situations. The first chapters of the book are devoted to the classical toolbox: topology and functional analysis, differential calculus, convex analysis and necessary conditions for differentiable constrained optimization. The remaining chapters are dedicated to more specialized topics and applications.Valuable to a wide audience, including students in mathematics, engineers, data scientists or economists, Classical and Modern Optimization contains more than 200 exercises to assist with self-study or for anyone teaching a third- or fourth-year optimization class."

Lectures on the geometry of manifolds,"Nicolaescu, Liviu I.","The object of this book is to introduce the reader to some of the most important techniques of modern global geometry. In writing it we had in mind the beginning graduate student willing to specialize in this very challenging field of mathematics. The necessary prerequisite is a good knowledge of the calculus with several variables, linear algebra and some elementary point-set topology.We tried to address several issues. 1. The Language; 2. The Problems; 3. The Methods; 4. The Answers.Historically, the problems came first, then came the methods and the language while the answers came last. The space constraints forced us to change this order and we had to painfully restrict our selection of topics to be covered. This process always involves a loss of intuition and we tried to balance this by offering as many examples and pictures as often as possible. We test most of our results and techniques on two basic classes examples: surfaces (which can be easily visualized) and Lie groups (which can be elegantly algebraized). When possible we present several facets of the same issue.We believe that a good familiarity with the formalism of differential geometry is absolutely necessary in understanding and solving concrete problems and this is why we presented it in some detail. Every new concept is supported by concrete examples interesting not only from an academic point of view.Our interest is mainly in global questions and in particular the interdependencegeometry ↔ topology, local ↔ global.We had to develop many algebraico-topological techniques in the special context of smooth manifolds. We spent a big portion of this book discussing the DeRham cohomology and its ramifications: Poincaré duality, intersection theory, degree theory, Thom isomorphism, characteristic classes, Gauss-Bonnet etc. We tried to calculate the cohomology groups of as many as possible concrete examples and we had to do this without relying on the powerful apparatus of homotopy theory (CW-complexes etc.). Some of the proofs are not the most direct ones but the means are sometimes more interesting than the ends. For example in computing the cohomology of complex grassmannians we returned to classical invariant theory and used some brilliant but unadvertised old ideas.In the last part of the book we discuss elliptic partial differential equations. This requires a familiarity with functional analysis. We painstakingly described the proofs of elliptic Lp and Hölder estimates (assuming some deep results of harmonic analysis) for arbitrary elliptic operators with smooth coefficients. It is not a “light meal” but the ideas are useful in a large number of instances. We present a few applications of these techniques (Hodge theory, uniformization theorem). We conclude with a close look to a very important class of elliptic operators namely the Dirac operators. We discuss their algebraic structure in some detail, Weizenböck formulæ and many concrete examples."

Posthumanism : a guide for the perplexed,"Mahon, Peter","In Posthumanism: A Guide for the Perplexed, Peter Mahon goes beyond recent theoretical approaches to 'the posthuman' to argue for a concrete posthumanism, which arises as humans, animals and technology become entangled, in science, society and culture. Concrete posthumanism is rooted in cutting-edge advances in techno-science, and this book offers readers an exciting, fresh and innovative exploration of this undulating, and often unstable, terrain. With wide-ranging coverage, of cybernetics, information theory, medicine, genetics, machine learning, politics, science fiction, philosophy and futurology, Mahon examines how posthumanism played-and continues to play-a crucial role in shaping how we understand our world. This analysis of posthumanism centers on human interactions with tools and technology, the centrality of science, as well as an understanding of techno-science as a pharmakon-an ancient Greek word for a substance that is both poison and cure. Mahon argues that posthumanism must be approached with an interdisciplinary attitude: a concrete posthumanism is only graspable through knowledge derived from science and the humanities. He concludes by sketching a 'post-humanities' to help us meet the challenges of posthumanism, challenges to which we all must rise. Posthumanism: A Guide for the Perplexed provides a concise, detailed and coherent exploration of posthumanism, introducing key approaches, concepts and themes. It is ideal for readers of all stripes who are interested in a concrete posthumanism and require more than just a simple introduction."
Rishi Sunak: the rise,"Ashcroft, Michael","Three years ago, Rishi Sunak was an unknown junior minister in the Department of Local Government. By the age of thirty-nine, he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, grappling with the gravest economic crisis in modern history. Michael Ashcroft's new book charts Sunak's ascent from his parents' Southampton pharmacy to Oxford University, the City of London, Silicon Valley – and the top of British politics. It is the tale of a super-bright and hard-grafting son of immigrant parents who marries an Indian heiress and makes a fortune of his own; a polished urban southerner who wins over the voters of rural North Yorkshire – and a cautious, fiscally conservative financier who becomes the biggest-spending Chancellor in history. Sunak was unexpectedly promoted to the Treasury's top job in February 2020, with a brief to spread investment and opportunity as part of Boris Johnson's 'levelling up' agenda. Within weeks, the coronavirus had sent Britain into lockdown, with thousands of firms in peril and millions of jobs on the line. As health workers battled to save lives, it was down to Sunak to save livelihoods. This is the story of how he tore up the rulebook and went for broke."
Women philosophers : genre and the boundaries of philosophy,"Gardner, Catherine Villanueva","Long considered ?non-philosophical,? the letters and novels of women like Catharine Macaulay, Mary Wollstonecraft, and George Eliot have often been omitted from the canon of the Western philosophical tradition. This unfortunate omission is corrected here through Catherine Villanueva Gardner's thorough discussion of the philosophical importance of their work. Gardner also looks carefully at why letters and novels have been considered this way since they are so prevalent in the work of women in general. Gardner argues that the devaluation or exclusion of certain forms of writing is connected to the biases that underpin the Western ethical tradition. This book is critical reading for courses in introductory philosophy and women's studies."

Ramayana unravelled : lesser known facets of rishi Valmiki's epic,"Ganatra, Ami","No epic has moved the consciousness of millions like the Ramayana. The appeal of the story of Rama is such that it has inspired the imagination of countless storytellers over the centuries, across the length and breadth of the subcontinent. From Jain poets to Bhavabhuti, from Kamban to Goswami Tulsidas, many have retold the Ramayana in their own language, infusing their own unique flavour. Though the story of Rama is much loved and well-known, questions prevail. Ramayana Unravelled attempts to address some key concerns: How did Rama's childhood and youth shape him? Why did Rama agree to go on vanvas – was it only to obey his father or was there more to it? How was the relationship of Rama and Seeta? Is the Ramayana inherently misogynist, considering the characterisation of Seeta, Shurpanakha, Kaikeyi and Tara? What led to the downfall of Ravan?

Christianity and politics in tribal India : Baptist missionaries and Naga nationalism,"Chophy, G. Kanato","Through an ethnohistorical study of the Nagas—a congeries of tribes inhabiting the Indo-Myanmar frontier—this book explores an unusually interesting region of India that is all too often seen as peripheral. G. Kanato Chophy provides a distinct vantage point for understanding the Nagas in relation to colonialism, missionary encounters, identity politics, and cultural change, all seamlessly woven around American Baptist mission history in this region. The book also analyses India's cacophonous postindependence democracy in order to delineate multifaith issues, multiculturalism, and ethnicity-based political movements. Within the West, episodic memories of the ""Great Awakening,"" a significant landmark in the history of Protestantism, have faded into archival records. But among the Nagas of the Indo-Myanmar highlands, Baptist Christianity persists as the dominant religion, influencing the daily lives of nearly three million people. Focusing variously on evangelical faith, missionary zeal, ethnic identities, political struggle, and complex culture wars, Christianity and Politics in Tribal India is an original and major study of how Protestant missions changed the history and destiny of a tribal community in one of the unlikeliest regions of South Asia."

Introducing aesthetics and the philosophy of art,"Hick, Darren Hudson","'Place in garden, lawn, to beautify landscape.' When Don Featherstone's plastic pink flamingos were first advertised in the 1957 Sears catalogue, these were the instructions. The flamingos are placed on the cover of this book for another reason: to start us asking questions. That's where philosophy always begins. Introducing Aesthetics and the Philosophy of Art is written to introduce students to a broad array of questions that have occupied philosophers since antiquity, and which continue to bother us today-questions like: - Is there something special about something's being art? Can a mass-produced plastic bird have that special something? - If someone likes plastic pink flamingos, does that mean they have bad taste? Is bad taste a bad thing? - Do Featherstone's pink flamingos mean anything? If so, does that depend on what Featherstone meant in designing them? Each chapter opens using a real world example - such as Marcel Duchamp's signed urinal, The Exorcist, and the ugliest animal in the world - to introduce and illustrate the issues under discussion. These case studies serve as touchstones throughout the chapter, keeping the concepts grounded and relatable. With its trademark conversational style, clear explanations, and wealth of supporting features, Introducing Aesthetics and the Philosophy of Art is the ideal introduction to the major problems, issues, and debates in the field. Now expanded and revised for its second edition, Introducing Aesthetics and the Philosophy of Art is designed to give readers the background and the tools necessary to begin asking and answering the most intriguing questions about art and beauty, even when those questions are about pink plastic flamingos."
Introduction to stochastic processes,"Chen, Mu-Fa","The objective of this book is to introduce the elements of stochastic processes in a rather concise manner where we present the two most important parts — Markov chains and stochastic analysis. The readers are led directly to the core of the main topics to be treated in the context. Further details and additional materials are left to a section containing abundant exercises for further reading and studying.In the part on Markov chains, the focus is on the ergodicity. By using the minimal nonnegative solution method, we deal with the recurrence and various types of ergodicity. This is done step by step, from finite state spaces to denumerable state spaces, and from discrete time to continuous time. The methods of proofs adopt modern techniques, such as coupling and duality methods. Some very new results are included, such as the estimate of the spectral gap. The structure and proofs in the first part are rather different from other existing textbooks on Markov chains.In the part on stochastic analysis, we cover the martingale theory and Brownian motions, the stochastic integral and stochastic differential equations with emphasis on one dimension, and the multidimensional stochastic integral and stochastic equation based on semimartingales. We introduce three important topics here: the Feynman-Kac formula, random time transform and Girsanov transform. As an essential application of the probability theory in classical mathematics, we also deal with the famous Brunn-Minkowski inequality in convex geometry.This book also features modern probability theory that is used in different fields, such as MCMC, or even deterministic areas: convex geometry and number theory. It provides a new and direct routine for students going through the classical Markov chains to the modern stochastic analysis."
Jacques Derrida : key concepts,"Colebrook, Claire","Continuum's Guides for the Perplexed are clear, concise and accessible introductions to thinkers, writers and subjects that students and readers can find especially challenging. Concentrating specifically on what it is that makes the subject difficult to fathom, these books explain and explore key themes and ideas, guiding the reader towards a thorough understanding of demanding material. Gilles Deleuze is undoubtedly one of the seminal figures in modern Continental thought. However, his philosophy makes considerable demands on the student; his major works make for challenging reading and require engagement with some difficult concepts and complex systems of thought. Deleuze: A Guide for the Perplexed is the ideal text for anyone who needs to get to grips with Deleuzian thought, offering a thorough, yet approachable account of the central themes in his work: sense; univocity; intuition; singularity; difference. His ideas related to language, politics, ethics and consciousness are explored in detail and - most importantly - clarified. The book also locates Deleuze in the context of his philosophical influences and antecedents and highlights the implications of his ideas for a range of disciplines from politics to film theory. Throughout, close attention is paid to Deleuze's most influential publications, including the landmark texts The Logic of Sense and Difference and Repetition. >"
Jacques Lacan,"Homer, Sean","Jacques Lacan is one of the most challenging and controversial of contemporary thinkers, as well as the most influential psychoanalyst since Freud. Lacanian theory has reached far beyond the consulting room to engage with such diverse disciplines as literature, film, gender and social theory. This book covers the full extent of Lacan's career and provides an accessible guide to Lacanian concepts and his writing on: the imaginary and the symbolic; the Oedipus Complex and the meaning of the phallus; the subject and the unconscious; the real; sexual difference. Locating Lacan's work in the context of contemporary French thought and the history of psychoanalysis, Sean Homer's Jacques Lacan is the ideal introduction to this influential theorist."
Judith Butler,"Salih, Sara","Judith Butler's work on gender, sexuality, identity, and the body has proved massively influential across a range of academic disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. Yet it is also notoriously difficult to access. This key book provides a comprehensive introduction to Butler's work, plus a critical examination of it and its precursors, both feminist (including Simone de Beauvoir, Monique Wittig, Julia Kristeva and Luce Irigaray), and non-feminist (including Erving Goffman, Michel Foucault, Jacques Lacan, and Jacques Derrida). The volume covers such topics as: gender as performance and performativity sociological notions of performance the materiality of the body and the role of biology power, identity and social regulation subjectivity, agency and feminist political practice. A comprehensive introduction to Butler’s work, this book also covers melancholia and gender identity, hate speech, pornography and 'race', social change and transformation, and Butler’s shifting relation to psychoanalysis. Clearly laid out to cover key themes for a student audience, this text will be an essential read for undergraduates in the fields of gender, psychoanalysis and sociology."
Lie Groups : a problem oriented introduction via matrix groups.,"Pollatsek, Harriet","This textbook is a complete introduction to Lie groups for undergraduate students. The only prerequisites are multi-variable calculus and linear algebra. The emphasis is placed on the algebraic ideas, with just enough analysis to define the tangent space and the differential and to make sense of the exponential map. This textbook works on the principle that students learn best when they are actively engaged. To this end nearly 200 problems are included in the text, ranging from the routine to the challenging level. Every chapter has a section called ?Putting the pieces together? in which all definitions and results are collected for reference and further reading is suggested."
Life.after.theory,"Payne, Michael","Is there life after theory? If the death of the Author has now been followed by the death of the Theorist, what's left? Indeed, who's left? To explore such riddles Life. After.Theory brings together new interviews with four theorists who are left, each a major figure in their own right: Jacques Derrida, Frank Kermode, Toril Moi, and Christopher Norris. Framed and introduced by Michael Payne and John Schad, the interviews pursue a whole range of topics, both familiar and unfamiliar. Among other things, Derrida, Kermode, Moi and Norris discuss being an outsider, taking responsibility, valuing books, getting angry, doing science, listening to music, remembering Empson, rereading de Beauvoir, being Jewish, asking forgiveness, smoking in libraries, befriending the dead, committing bigamy, forgetting to forget, thinking, not thinking, believing, and being mad. These four key thinkers explore why there is life after theory...but not as we know it. Jacques Derrida is Professor at the +cole des Hautes +tudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris. He is the author of a range of extraordinarily influential works including Of Grammatology, Writing and Difference and Dissemination. Sir Frank Kermode is a former King Edward VII Professor of English Literature at the University of Cambridge and author of, among many other books, The Sense of An Ending: Studies in the Theory of Fiction, Shakespeare's Language, and Not Entitled, his memoirs. Toril Moi is James B. Duke Professor of Literature and Romance Studies at Duke University. Her books include Sexual/Textual Politics: Feminist Literary Theory, Simone de Beauvoir: The Making of an Intellectual Woman and What Is a Woman? And Other Essays. Christopher Norris is Distinguished Research Professor in Philosophy at the University of Cardiff. He has published some twenty books to date, including, most recently, Deconstruction and the Unfinished Project of Modernity, Quantum Theory and the Flight from Realism, Truth Matters: Realism, Anti-Realism, and Response-Dependence, and Hilary Putnam: Reason, Realism, and the Uses of Uncertainty."

Narrating nomadism : tales of recovery and resistance,"Devy, G. N.","Narrating Nomadism provides an unflinching account of ethnic groups and nomadic communities across the world that were branded as ‘criminal’ during colonial times. It explores the tragic effect of the new identity imposed on them, the traumatic survival of these communities and cultures, and the creative expression of this experience in their arts and literature in the form of resistance. Presenting specific contexts and locations of cultural devastation in history, the volume traces colonial social imagination as such, showing how the grossly misperceived non-sedentary communities in the colonies were subjected to the mission of ‘settling’ them. The essays presented here document these alternative histories from perspectives ranging from literary criticism and art history to ethnography and socio-linguistics, highlighting in what ways different nomadic communities negotiate discrimination and challenge in contemporary times, while finding remarkable convergence in their local histories and collective testimonies. This anthology opens up a new area in postcolonial studies as well as cultural anthropology by bringing the viewpoint of marginalized communities and their cultural rights to bear upon history, society and culture. It places an activist’s ‘view from below’ at the centre of literary interpretation, engages with oral history more substantially than folklore studies usually do, and brings together several historical narratives hitherto unexplored. This will be essential for students of anthropology, sociology, cultural studies, history, linguistics, post-colonial studies, literature and tribal studies, as well as the general reader."
"Nationalism in the vernacular : hindi, urdu, and the literature of Indian freedom","Nijhawan, Shobna","Hindi Publishing in Colonial Lucknow centers on the literary activities emerging out of the publishing house Ganga Pustak Mala in colonial Lucknow in the first half of the twentieth century. Closely associated with Ganga Pustak Mala was the Hindi monthly Sudha (lit. nectar, ambrosia), aliterary, social, political and illustrated periodical, in which Hindi writings in prose and poetry, including Hindi literary criticism, and other activities concerning the Hindi public sphere, such as language politics, social reforms, matters concerning lifestyle, health, arts and sciences, andthe political emancipation of women and men were promoted and developed. Building on the defining work of Gerard Genette on paratexts as well as on scholarship on text-image relationships, this book charts the literary networks established by the publishing house's proprietor and chief editor of Sudha, Dularelal Bhargava, who played a pivotal role in the emergence ofHindi literary production out of Lucknow and in the commercialization and nationalization of Hindi literature in the north Indian Hindi public sphere."

On resistance : a philosophy of defiance,"Caygill, Howard","No word is more central to the contemporary political imagination and action than 'resistance'. In its various manifestations - from the armed guerrilla to Gandhian mass pacifist protest, from Wikileaks and the Arab Spring to the global eruption and violent repression of the Occupy movement - concepts of resistance are becoming ubiquitous and urgent. In this book, Howard Caygill conducts the first ever systematic analysis of 'resistance': as a means of defying political oppression, in its relationship with military violence and its cultural representation. Beginning with the militaristic doctrine of Clausewitz and the evolution of a new model of guerrilla warfare to resist the forces of Napoleonic France, On Resistance elucidates and critiques the contributions of seminal resistant thinkers from Marx and Nietzsche to Mao, Gandhi, Sartre and Fanon to identify continuities of resistance and rebellion from the Paris Commune to the Greenham Women's Peace Camp. Employing a threefold line of inquiry, Caygill exposes the persistent discourses through which resistance has been framed in terms of force, violence, consciousness and subjectivity to evolve a critique of resistance. Tracing the features of resistance, its strategies, character and habitual forms throughout modern world history Caygill identifies the typological consistencies which make up resistance. Finally, by teasing out the conceptual nuances of resistance and its affinities to concepts of repression, reform and revolution, Caygill reflects upon contemporary manifestations of resistance to identify whether the 21st century is evolving new understandings of protest and struggle."
Optical spectroscopy : fundamentals and advanced applications,"Roduner, Emil","Developments in optical spectroscopy have taken new directions in recent decades, with the focus shifting from understanding small gas phase molecules towards applications in materials and biological systems. This is due to significant interest in these topics, which has been facilitated by significant technological developments.Absorption, luminescence and excited state energy transfer properties have become of crucial importance on a large scale in materials related to light-harvesting in organic and inorganic third generation solar cells, for solar water splitting, and in light emitting diodes, TV screens and many other applications. In addition, Förster resonance energy transfer can be used as a ruler for the characterisation of the structure and dynamics of DNA, proteins and other biomolecules via labelling with fluorescing markers.This advanced textbook covers a range of these applications as well as the basics of absorption, emission and energy transfer of molecular systems in the condensed phase, in addition to the corresponding behaviour of metal nanoparticles and semiconductor quantum dots. Technical experimental requirements, aspects to avoid interfering perturbations and methods of quantitative data analysis make this book accessible and ideal for students and researchers in physical chemistry, biophysics and nanomaterials."
Philosophical issues in Indian cinema : approximate terms and concepts,"Raghavendra, M. K.","This book interrogates the vocabulary used in theorizing about Indian cinema to reach into the deeper cultural meanings of philosophies and traditions from which it derives its influences. It re-examines terms and concepts used in film criticism and contextualizes them within the aesthetics, poetics and politics of Indian cinema. The book looks at terms and concepts borrowed from the scholarship on American and world cinema and explores their use and relevance in describing the characteristics and evolution of cinema in India. It highlights how realism, romance and melodrama in the context of India appear in a culturally singular way and how the aggregation of constituent elements – like songs, action, comedy – in Indian film can be traced to classical theatre and other diverse religious and philosophical influences. These influences have characterized popular film and drama in India which present all aspects of life for a diverse nation. The author explores concepts like ‘fantasy’, ‘family’ and ‘patriotism’ by using various examples from films in India and outside, as well as practices in the other arts. He identifies the fundamental logic behind the choices made by film-makers in India and discusses concepts which allow for a fresh theorizing on Indian cinema’s characteristics. This book will be of great interest to students and researchers of film studies, media studies, cultural studies, literature, cultural history and South Asian studies. It will also be useful for general readers who are interested in learning more about Indian cinema, its forms, origins and influences."
Philosophy of history : a guide for students,"Lemon, M. C.","Philosophy of History is an essential introduction to a vast body of writing about history, from classical Greece and Rome to the modern world. M.C. Lemon maps out key debates and central concepts of philosophy of history, placing principal thinkers in the context of their times and schools of thought. Lemon explains the crucial differences between speculative philosophy as an enquiry into the content of history, and analytic philosophy of history as relating to the methods of history. The first two parts of the book trace each of these traditions, whereas the third part revisits both in the light of recent contributions to the discipline. This guide provides a comprehensive survey of historical thought since ancient times. Its clear terminology and lucid argument will make it an invaluable source for students and teachers alike."

Design Culture Reader,"Highmore, Ben","This new study from Ben Highmore looks at the seemingly banal world of objects, work, daily media, and food, and finds there a scintillating array of passionate experience. Through a series of case studies, and building on his previous work on the everyday, Highmore examines our relationship to familiar objects (a favourite chair), repetitive work (housework, typing), media (distracted television viewing and radio listening) and food (specifically the food of multicultural Britain). A chair allows him to consider the history of flat-pack furniture as well as the lively presence of inorganic ‘stuff’ in our daily lives. Distracted television watching and radio listening becomes one of the preconditions for experiencing wonder through the media. Ordinary Lives links the concrete study of routine existence to theoretical reflection on everyday life. The book discusses philosophers such as Jacques Rancière, William James and David Hume and combines them with autobiographical testimonies, historical research and the analysis of popular culture to investigate the minutiae of day-to-day life. Highmore argues that aesthetic experience is embedded in the mundane sensory world of everyday life. He asks the reader to reconsider the negative associations of habit and routine, focusing specifically on the intrinsic ambiguity of habit (habit, we find out, is both rigid and adaptive). Rather than ask ‘what does everyday life mean?’ this book asks ‘what does everyday life feel like and how do our sensual, emotional and temporal experiences interconnect and intersect?’ Ordinary Lives is an accessible, animated and engaging book that is ideally suited to both students and researchers working in cultural studies, media and communication and sociology."

In this book, Francis Robinson considers the challenges Western dominance has offered key aspects of Muslim civilization, particularly in the context of South Asia, which in the nineteenth century moved from being a receiver of influences from the rest of the Muslim world to being a transmitter of influences to it. Robinson also considers aspects of the Muslim revival and how they have come to shape, in various ways, Muslim responses to Western dominance. The role of the transmission of knowledge, both formal and spiritual, in forming Muslim societies is explored, and also the particular role of the transmitters in sustaining the Islamic dimensions of Muslim societies under Western dominance. Attention, too, is paid to the imposition of the modern state and the restriction of cosmopolitan spaces."

Emergence of brand-name capitalism in late colonial India : advertising and the making of modern conjugality,"Haynes, Douglas E.","This book examines the emergence of professional advertising in western India during the interwar period. It explores the ways in which global manufacturers advanced a 'brand-name capitalism' among the Indian middle class by promoting the sale of global commodities during the 1920s and 1930s, a time when advertising was first introduced in India as a profession and underwent critical transformations. Analysing the cultural strategies, both verbal and visual, used by foreign businesses in their advertisements to capture urban consumers, Haynes argues that the promoters of various commodities crystalized their campaigns around principles of modern conjugality. He also highlights the limitations of brand-name capitalism during this period, examining both its inability to cultivate markets in the countryside or among the urban poor, and its failure to secure middle-class customers. With numerous examples of illustrated advertisements taken from Indian newspapers, the book discusses campaigns for male sex tonics and women's medicines, hot drinks such as Ovaltine and Horlicks, soaps such as Lifebuoy, Lux and Sunlight, cooking mediums such as Dalda and electrical household technologies. By examining the formation of 'brand-name capitalism' and two key structures that accompanied it- the advertising agency and the field of professional advertising- this book sheds new light on the global consumer economy in interwar India, and places developments in South Asia into a larger global history of consumer capitalism."

Managing the 21st century parent : How colleges' partnerships with families can boost student success,"Tugend, Alina","Engaging with parents has become a major challenge for many colleges. It's not just ""helicopter"" parents--known to be affluent and demanding--who complain these days about their children's grades, job prospects, housing, roommates, and much more. Parents increasingly see themselves as consumers, and question the value of a college education. Colleges also worry that students aren't becoming independent enough. At the same time, many institutions are seeking more engagement with families of low-income and first-generation students, who often may not understand college culture.This issue brief will examine how colleges navigate the crucial parental / family relationship.

Nights of plague,"Pamuk, Orhan","From the the winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature: Part detective story, part historical epic—a bold and brilliant novel that imagines a plague ravaging a fictional island in the Ottoman Empire. It is April 1900, in the Levant, on the imaginary island of Mingheria—the twenty-ninth state of the Ottoman Empire—located in the eastern Mediterranean between Crete and Cyprus. Half the population is Muslim, the other half are Orthodox Greeks, and tension is high between the two. When a plague arrives—brought either by Muslim pilgrims returning from the Mecca or by merchant vessels coming from Alexandria—the island revolts. To stop the epidemic, the Ottoman sultan Abdul Hamid II sends his most accomplished quarantine expert to the island—an Orthodox Christian. Some of the Muslims, including followers of a popular religious sect and its leader Sheikh Hamdullah, refuse to take precautions or respect the quarantine. And then a murder occurs. As the plague continues its rapid spread, the Sultan sends a second doctor to the island, this time a Muslim, and strict quarantine measures are declared. But the incompetence of the island’s governor and local administration and the people’s refusal to respect the bans doom the quarantine to failure, and the death count continues to rise. Faced with the danger that the plague might spread to the West and to Istanbul, the Sultan bows to international pressure and allows foreign and Ottoman warships to blockade the island. Now the people of Mingheria are on their own, and they must find a way to defeat the plague themselves. Steeped in history and rife with suspense, Nights of Plague is an epic story set more than one hundred years ago, with themes that feel remarkably contemporary."
"Science, religion and deep time","Gustafson, Lowell S.","This book examines the meaning of religion within the scientific, evidence-based history of our known past since the big bang. While our current major religions are only centuries or millennia old, our volume discusses the origins and development of human religious practice and belief over our species’ existence of 300,000 years. The volume also connects the scientific approach to natural and social history with ancient truths of our religious ancestors using new lines of inquiry, new technologies, new modes of expression, and new concepts. It brings together insights of natural scientists, social scientists, philosophers, writers, and theologians to discuss narratives of the universe. The essays discuss that to apprehend religion scientifically, or to interpret and explain science theologically, the subject must be examined through a variety of disciplinary lenses simultaneously and raise several theoretical, philosophical, and moral problems. With a singular investigation into the meaning of religion in the context of the 13.8 billion-year history of our universe, this book will be indispensable for scholars and students of religious studies, big history, sociology and social anthropology, philosophy, and science and technology studies."

Dynamical systems and linear algebra,"Colonius, Fritz","This book provides an introduction to the interplay between linear algebra and dynamical systems in continuous time and in discrete time. It first reviews the autonomous case for one matrix A via induced dynamical systems in ℝd and on Grassmannian manifolds. Then the main nonautonomous approaches are presented for which the time dependency of A(t) is given via skew-product flows using periodicity, or topological (chain recurrence) or ergodic properties (invariant measures). The authors develop generalizations of (real parts of) eigenvalues and eigenspaces as a starting point for a linear algebra for classes of time-varying linear systems, namely periodic, random, and perturbed (or controlled) systems. The book presents for the first time in one volume a unified approach via Lyapunov exponents to detailed proofs of Floquet theory, of the properties of the Morse spectrum, and of the multiplicative ergodic theorem for products of random matrices. The main tools, chain recurrence and Morse decompositions, as well as classical ergodic theory are introduced in a way that makes the entire material accessible for beginning graduate students."

Gravel heart,"Gurnah, Abdulrazak","Moving from revolutionary Zanzibar in the 1960s to restless London in the 1990s, Gravel Heart is a powerful story of exile, migration and betrayal, from the Booker Prize-shortlisted author of Paradise Salim has always believed that his father does not want him. Living with his parents and his adored Uncle Amir in a house full of secrets, he is a bookish child, a dreamer haunted by night terrors. It is the 1970s and Zanzibar is changing. Tourists arrive, the island's white sands obscuring the memory of recent conflict: longed-for independence from British colonialism swiftly followed by bloody revolution. When his father moves out, retreating into dishevelled introspection, Salim is confused and ashamed. His mother explains neither this nor her absences with a strange man; silence is layered on silence. When glamorous Uncle Amir, now a senior diplomat, offers Salim an escape, the lonely teenager travels to London for college. But nothing has prepared him for the biting cold and seething crowds of this hostile city. Struggling to find a foothold, and to understand the darkness at the heart of his family, Salim must face devastating truths about himself and those closest to him – and about love, sex and power. Evoking the immigrant experience with unsentimental precision and profound insight, Gravel Heart is a powerfully affecting story of isolation, identity, belonging and betrayal, and is Abulrazak Gurnah's most dazzling achievement."

My journeys in economic theory,"Phelps, Edmund S.","Edmund Phelps is among the most important economists of his generation. He developed a new understanding of unemployment and inflation and went on to rethink the roots of innovation. His work represents a lifelong project to put “people as we know them” into economic theory. In this book, Phelps tells the story of his role in reshaping economic theory, offering a powerful personal account of a creative and rewarding career. My Journeys in Economic Theory charts two major phases of Phelps’s work, illuminating the breadth of his contributions to the field. First, introducing the expectations of wage setters and cofounding the “equilibrium” rate of unemployment, he built the microeconomic foundations for the employment theory pioneered by Keynes and Hicks. More recently, he conceived a theory of “mass flourishing” superseding Schumpeter and Solow’s conception of the process of innovating—a theory in which individuals’ creativity and society’s dynamism fuel grassroots innovation and generate job satisfaction in the process. Phelps recounts his vivid experiences in the world of economics—fierce arguments, competition and collaboration, and the good fortune of time spent among some great figures—as well as his relationships with luminaries such as John Rawls, Thomas Nagel, Paul Samuelson, and Paul Volcker. At its core, this book shares the joy of intellectual achievement: the excitement of coming up with a new idea that radically departs from prevailing views and the satisfaction of exercising one’s own ingenuity instead of applying or developing others’ models. Telling the story of a life packed with intellectual adventure, My Journeys in Economic Theory provides a profound vision of a dynamic, modern economy that offers lives rich with creativity and meaning."

Rules : a short history of what we live by,"Daston, Lorraine","A panoramic history of rules in the Western world Rules order almost every aspect of our lives. They set our work hours, dictate how we drive and set the table, tell us whether to offer an extended hand or cheek in greeting, and organize the rites of life, from birth through death. We may chafe under the rules we have, and yearn for ones we don’t, yet no culture could do without them. In Rules, historian Lorraine Daston traces their development in the Western tradition and shows how rules have evolved from ancient to modern times. Drawing on a rich trove of examples, including legal treatises, cookbooks, military manuals, traffic regulations, and game handbooks, Daston demonstrates that while the content of rules is dazzlingly diverse, the forms that they take are surprisingly few and long-lived. Daston uncovers three enduring kinds of rules: the algorithms that calculate and measure, the laws that govern, and the models that teach. She vividly illustrates how rules can change—how supple rules stiffen, or vice versa, and how once bothersome regulations become everyday norms. Rules have been devised for almost every imaginable activity and range from meticulous regulations to the laws of nature. Daston probes beneath this variety to investigate when rules work and when they don’t, and why some philosophical problems about rules are as ancient as philosophy itself while others are as modern as calculating machines. Rules offers a wide-angle view on the history of the constraints that guide us—whether we know it or not."

"Anthropologist and imperialist : H.H. Risley and British India, 1873-1911","Fuller, C. J.","Sir Herbert Hope Risley (1851 - 1911) - 'H. H. Risley', as he always signed himself - was a member of the Indian Civil Service (ICS) from 1873 to 1910 who served in Bengal and became a senior administrator and policymaker in the colonial government, as well as the pre-eminent anthropologist in British India. He was also an imperialist, who was convinced of the rightness of 'civilising' British rule and its benefits for both India and Britain, and one of this book's objectives is to render his simultaneous commitment to anthropology and imperialism intelligible to present-day readers. More specifically, Anthropologist and Imperialist: H. H. Risley and British India, 1873–1911 documents the two sides of Risley’s career, which is used as a case-study to investigate, first, the production and circulation of colonial knowledge, specifically anthropological knowledge, and secondly, its often loose and inconsistent connection with administration and policymaking, and with the government and state overall. Risley, like other officials engaged in anthropology in India, as well as the government itself, insisted that ethnography and anthropology had both ‘administrative’ and ‘scientific’ value; unlike previous works on Indian colonial anthropology, this book carefully examines its ‘scientific’ contributions in relation to contemporary metropolitan anthropology. It does not attempt to reinvent ‘greatman’ political or intellectual history, but does demonstrate the importance of studying the powerful officials who ruled British India, as well as the minor provincial politicians and subaltern subjects – or the abstract forces, such as colonialism and resistance – that have dominated recent historical scholarship. This book shows, too, that a detailed inquiry into Risley’s career, and his ideas and actions, can open new perspectives on a variety of continuing debates, including those over the colonial construction of caste and race in ‘traditional’ India, orientalism and forms of colonial knowledge, Victorian anthropology’s close relationship with the British empire, and the modern discipline’s uneasy links with its colonial past.

Cosmopolitan dreams : the making of modern Urdu literary culture in colonial South Asia,"Dubrow, Jennifer","In late nineteenth-century South Asia, the arrival of print fostered a dynamic and interactive literary culture. There, within the pages of Urdu-language periodicals and newspapers, readers found a public sphere that not only catered to their interests but encouraged their reactions to featured content. Cosmopolitan Dreams brings this culture to light, showing how literature became a site in which modern daily life could be portrayed and satirized, the protocols of modernity challenged, and new futures imagined. Drawing on never-before-translated Urdu fiction and prose and focusing on the novel and satire, Jennifer Dubrow shows that modern Urdu literature was defined by its practice of self-critique and parody. Urdu writers resisted the cultural models offered by colonialism, creating instead a global community of imagination in which literary models could freely circulate and be readapted, mixed, and drawn upon to develop alternative lines of thinking. Highlighting the participation of readers and writers from diverse social and religious backgrounds, the book reveals an Urdu cosmopolis where lively debates thrived in newspapers, literary journals, and letters to the editor, shedding fresh light on the role of readers in shaping vernacular literary culture. Arguing against current understandings of Urdu as an exclusively Muslim language, Dubrow demonstrates that in the late nineteenth century, Urdu was a cosmopolitan language spoken by a transregional, transnational community that eschewed identities of religion, caste, and class. The Urdu cosmopolis pictured here was soon fractured by the forces of nationalism and communalism. Even so, Dubrow is able to establish the persistence of Urdu cosmopolitanism into the present and shows that Urdu’s strong tradition as a language of secular, critical modernity did not end in the late nineteenth century but continues to flourish in film, television, and on line. In lucid prose, Dubrow makes the dynamic world of colonial Urdu print culture come to life in a way that will interest scholars of modern Asian literatures, South Asian literature and history, cosmopolitanism, and the history of print culture."

The strangeness of Tamil Nadu : contemporary history and political culture in South India,"Pandian, M. S. S","M.S.S. Pandian (1958 2014) was an eminent historian of South Indian politics, caste, culture, and cinema. His writings offer distinctively Tamil insights on these areas. In this book his chief focus is Tamil political culture for roughly thirty years since 1985. His success lies in bringing a historical understanding to bear on what he called the strangeness of Tamil Nadu . A key figure in Pandian s thinking was E.V. Ramasamy Periyar . Pandian argues that Periyar s ideals and strategies long remained popular among Tamil progressives, but that their survival became difficult because of radical changes in pan-Indian political culture. To show these changes, this book is organised chronologically as well as along thematic sections that reflect the themes of Periyar s Dravidian ideology: linguistic identity, state politics, religion, and caste. Periyar s ideas, Pandian argues, can still provide productive standards for critical analysis of politics in India. But because they are not widely known or appreciated outside Tamil Nadu, they represent the strangeness of Tamil politics instead of being adapted as progressive in the country as a whole."

The truths and lies of nationalism : as narrated by Charvak,"Chatterjee, Partha","Written in the voice of the mythical atheist, naysayer, and general all-purpose heretic of Indian philosophy, The Truths and Lies of Nationalism as Narrated by Charvak presents a completely new way of telling the history of Indian nationalism. Severely criticizing the doctrines of both Hindu nationalism and pluralist secularism, it examines the ongoing debates over Indian civilization and recounts in detail how the present borders of India were defined by British colonial policy, the partition of 1947, and the integration of the princely states and the French and Portuguese territories. The emphasis is not so much on the state machinery inherited from colonial times but on the moral foundation of a new republic based on the solidarity of different but equal formations of the people. After a trenchant critique of the present-day conflicts over religion, caste, class, gender, language, and region in India, the book proposes a new politics of revitalized federalism. Intended for a general readership, and eschewing academic jargon, this book will be of interest to anyone concerned about the future of India."

What is theory? cultural theory as discourse and dialogue,"Zima, Pierre V","The term theory is nowadays most commonly defined in relation to the concept of scientific knowledge. Yet the etymological background of the term reminds us that theory is in fact a way of viewing objects and of relating them to one another within a particular kind of discourse. The word discourse implies that we are dealing with linguistic structures and that, in the realm of cultural and social sciences, theory can therefore only be understood as a linguistic construct. In what is theory?, Peter V.Zima argues that this concept of theory has never been adequately analysed. He asserts that social scientists have been dealing with concepts such as culture ideology language and discourse without ever attempting to define the concept of theory itself. This new study re-examines the most important theoretical debates of the twentieth-century and, in engaging with the critical work of Adorno, Horkheimer and Bakhtin, offers an alternative concept of theory, one that is dialectical and dialogical, relating contradictory theoretical positions to one another in order to test them in systematic confrontation. In a critical development of popper's idea of refusability and testability, Zima's theory opens up new perspectives and reveals pitfalls and problems which the traditional approach often obscures."

Ashoka : Portrait of a philosopher king,"Olivelle, Patrick","An illuminating biography reconstructing the life and legacy of a unique king in world history and the most famous emperor in South Asian history ""Mr. Olivelle has produced an outstanding monument of scholarship and sound judgment.""--Maxwell Carter, Wall Street Journal There are few historical figures more integral to South Asian history than Emperor Ashoka, a third-century BCE king who ruled over a larger area of the Indian subcontinent than anyone else before British colonial rule. Ashoka sought not only to rule his territory but also to give it a unity of purpose and aspiration, to unify the people of his vastly heterogeneous empire not by a cult of personality but by the cult of an idea--""dharma""--which served as the linchpin of a new moral order. He aspired to forge a new moral philosophy that would be internalized not only by the people of his empire but also by rulers and subjects of other countries, and would form the foundation for his theory of international relations, in which practicing dharma would bring international conflicts to an end. His fame spread far and wide both in India and in other parts of Asia, and it prompted diverse reimaginations of the king and his significance. In this deeply researched book, Patrick Olivelle draws on Ashoka's inscriptions and on the art and architecture he pioneered to craft a detailed picture of Ashoka as a ruler, a Buddhist, a moral philosopher, and an ecumenist who governed a vast multiethnic, multilinguistic, and multireligious empire."

Think stats,"Downey, Allen","If you know how to program, you have the skills to turn data into knowledge using the tools of probability and statistics. This concise introduction shows you how to perform statistical analysis computationally, rather than mathematically, with programs written in Python. You'll work with a case study throughout the book to help you learn the entire data analysis process—from collecting data and generating statistics to identifying patterns and testing hypotheses. Along the way, you'll become familiar with distributions, the rules of probability, visualization, and many other tools and concepts. Develop your understanding of probability and statistics by writing and testing code Run experiments to test statistical behavior, such as generating samples from several distributions Use simulations to understand concepts that are hard to grasp mathematically Learn topics not usually covered in an introductory course, such as Bayesian estimation Import data from almost any source using Python, rather than be limited to data that has been cleaned and formatted for statistics tools Use statistical inference to answer questions about real-world data"
Leibniz : an intellectual biography,"Antognazza, Maria Rosa","Of all the thinkers of the century of genius that inaugurated modern philosophy, none lived an intellectual life more rich and varied than Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716). Trained as a jurist and employed as a counsellor, librarian, and historian, he made famous contributions to logic, mathematics, physics, and metaphysics, yet viewed his own aspirations as ultimately ethical and theological, and married these theoretical concerns with politics, diplomacy, and an equally broad range of practical reforms: juridical, economic, administrative, technological, medical, and ecclesiastical. Maria Rosa Antognazza's pioneering biography not only surveys the full breadth and depth of these theoretical interests and practical activities, it also weaves them together for the first time into a unified portrait of this unique thinker and the world from which he came. At the centre of the huge range of Leibniz's apparently miscellaneous endeavours, Antognazza reveals a single master project lending unity to his extraordinarily multifaceted life's work. Throughout the vicissitudes of his long life, Leibniz tenaciously pursued the dream of a systematic reform and advancement of all the sciences, to be undertaken as a collaborative enterprise supported by an enlightened ruler; these theoretical pursuits were in turn ultimately grounded in a practical goal: the improvement of the human condition and thereby the celebration of the glory of God in His creation. As well as tracing the threads of continuity that bound these theoretical and practical activities to this all-embracing plan, this illuminating study also traces these threads back into the intellectual traditions of the Holy Roman Empire in which Leibniz lived and throughout the broader intellectual networks that linked him to patrons in countries as distant as Russia and to correspondents as far afield as China."

Fire and blood,"Martin, George R. R.","The thrilling history of the Targaryens comes to life in this masterly work by the author of A Song of Ice and Fire, the inspiration for HBO's Game of Thrones. With all the fire and fury fans have come to expect from internationally bestselling author George R. R. Martin, this is the first volume of the definitive two-part history of the Targaryens in Westeros. Centuries before the events of A Game of Thrones, House Targaryen--the only family of dragonlords to survive the Doom of Valyria--took up residence on Dragonstone. Fire and Blood begins their tale with the legendary Aegon the Conqueror, creator of the Iron Throne, and goes on to recount the generations of Targaryens who fought to hold that iconic seat, all the way up to the civil war that nearly tore their dynasty apart. What really happened during the Dance of the Dragons? Why did it become so deadly to visit Valyria after the Doom? What is the origin of Daenerys's three dragon eggs? These are but a few of the questions answered in this essential chronicle, as related by a learned maester of the Citadel and featuring more than eighty all-new black-and-white illustrations by artist Doug Wheatley. Readers have glimpsed small parts of this narrative in such volumes as The World of Ice & Fire, but now, for the first time, the full tapestry of Targaryen history is revealed. With all the scope and grandeur of Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Fire and Blood is the ultimate game of thrones, giving readers a whole new appreciation for the dynamic, often bloody, and always fascinating history of Westeros."

Senses of the subject,"Butler, Judith","This book brings together a group of Judith Butler’s philosophical essays written over two decades that elaborate her reflections on the roles of the passions in subject formation through an engagement with Hegel, Kierkegaard, Descartes, Spinoza, Malebranche, Merleau-Ponty, Freud, Irigaray, and Fanon. Drawing on her early work on Hegelian desire and her subsequent reflections on the psychic life of power and the possibility of self-narration, this book considers how passions such as desire, rage, love, and grief are bound up with becoming a subject within specific historical fields of power. Butler shows in different philosophical contexts how the self that seeks to make itself finds itself already affected and formed against its will by social and discursive powers. And yet, agency and action are not necessarily nullified by this primary impingement. Primary sense impressions register this dual situation of being acted on and acting, countering the idea that acting requires one to overcome the situation of being affected by others and the linguistic and social world. This dual structure of sense sheds light on the desire to live, the practice and peril of grieving, embodied resistance, love, and modes of enthrallment and dispossession. Working with theories of embodiment, desire, and relationality in conversation with philosophers as diverse as Hegel, Spinoza, Descartes, Merleau-Ponty, Freud, and Fanon, Butler reanimates and revises her basic propositions concerning the constitution and deconstitution of the subject within fields of power, taking up key issues of gender, sexuality, and race in several analyses. Taken together, these essays track the development of Butler’s embodied account of ethical relations."

Code dependent : living in the shadow of AI,"Murgia, Madhumita","Shortlisted for the Women’s Prize for Non-Fiction Named a best book of the year by Esquire, The Spectator and Publishers Weekly A riveting story of what it means to be human in a world changed by artificial intelligence, revealing the perils and inequities of our growing reliance on automated decision-making On the surface, a British poet, an UberEats courier in Pittsburgh, an Indian doctor, and a Chinese activist in exile have nothing in common. But they are in fact linked by a profound common experience—unexpected encounters with artificial intelligence. In Code Dependent, Murgia shows how automated systems are reshaping our lives all over the world, from technology that marks children as future criminals, to an app that is helping to give diagnoses to a remote tribal community. AI has already infiltrated our day-to-day, through language-generating chatbots like ChatGPT and social media. But it’s also affecting us in more insidious ways. It touches everything from our interpersonal relationships, to our kids’ education, work, finances, public services, and even our human rights. By highlighting the voices of ordinary people in places far removed from the cozy enclave of Silicon Valley, Code Dependent explores the impact of a set of powerful, flawed, and often-exploitative technologies on individuals, communities, and our wider society. Murgia exposes how AI can strip away our collective and individual sense of agency, and shatter our illusion of free will. The ways in which algorithms and their effects are governed over the coming years will profoundly impact us all. Yet we can’t agree on a common path forward. We cannot decide what preferences and morals we want to encode in these entities—or what controls we may want to impose on them. And thus, we are collectively relinquishing our moral authority to machines. In Code Dependent, Murgia not only sheds light on this chilling phenomenon, but also charts a path of resistance. AI is already changing what it means to be human, in ways large and small, and Murgia reveals what could happen if we fail to reclaim our humanity."
Human computer interaction : user-centric computing for design,"Bhattacharya, Samit","This is a book about the design of computers from the user's point of view. The emphasis is on people, rather than the technology. This book is about the directions in which computers must move. This is a book of ideas, of analytical techniques described for their purpose, a book from which to derive the new questions in which design must move. The essays are pluralistic, offering a variety of perspectives, including the traditional study of human information processing structures, the subjective experience of the user and how to enhance it, and the social context of computing. The authors hope that the ideas discussed herein will lead to new kinds of interfaces--new, different, and more user friendly."
Human-computer interaction : fundamentals and practice,"Kim, Gerard Jounghyun","Although life continues to become increasingly embedded with interactive computing services that make our lives easier, human-computer interaction (HCI) has not been given the attention it deserves in the education of software developers at the undergraduate level. Most entry-level HCI textbooks are structured around high-level concepts and are not directly tied to the software development process. Filling this need, Human-Computer Interaction: Fundamentals and Practice supplies an accessible introduction to the entire cycle of HCI design and implementation-explaining the core HCI concepts behind each step. Designed around the overall development cycle for an interactive software product, it starts off by covering the fundamentals behind HCI. The text then quickly goes into the application of this knowledge. It covers the forming of HCI requirements, modeling the interaction process, designing the interface, implementing the resulting design, and evaluating the implemented product. Although this textbook is suitable for undergraduate students of computer science and information technology, it is accessible enough to be understood by those with minimal programming knowledge. Supplying readers with a firm foundation in the main HCI principles, the book provides a working knowledge of HCI-oriented software development. The core content of this book is based on the introductory HCI course (advanced junior or senior-level undergraduate) that the author has been teaching at Korea University for the past eight years. The book includes access to PowerPoint lecture slides as well as source code for the example applications used throughout the text."

Baluta,"Pawar, Daya","The first Dalit autobiography to be published, Baluta caused a sensation when it first appeared, in Marathi, in 1978. It quickly acquired the status of a classic of modern Indian literature and was also a bestseller in Hindi and other major languages. This is the first time that it has been translated into English. Set in Mumbai and rural Maharashtra of the 1940s and '50s, it describes in shocking detail the practice of untouchability and caste violence. But it also speaks of the pride and courage of the Dalit community that often fought back for dignity. Most unusually, Baluta is also a frank account of the author's own failings and contradictions-his passions, prejudices and betrayals-as also those of some leading lights of the Dalit movement. In addition, it is a rare record of life in Maharashtra's villages and in the slums, chawls and gambling dens of Mumbai."

Mahad:the making of the first dalit revolt,"Teltumbde, Anand","MAHAD has an iconic place in Dalit universe. Associated with legendary personality of Dr Ambedkar, the struggle of Dalits at Mahad for asserting their rights to access the public tank, the Chavadar tank, arguably ranks among the first civil rights struggles in history. Unfortunately, it remained largely confined to folklore; its detailed account still remaining fragmented and in mostly Marathi. This book provides a comprehensive account, using many sources including the archival materials, of the two conferences in Mahad in 1927 that marks the beginning of the Dalit movement under Babasaheb Ambedkar to a wider readership in English. It tries to frame it within its historical context which will help people comprehend its historical significance. It also seeks to draw certain lessons for the future course of the Dalit movement. The book additionally contains the original account of Comrade R. B. MORE, the organizer of the first conference at Mahad."
The king of kings,"Munshi, Kanaiyalal Maneklal","A mysterious emissary arrives in the port city of Bhrigukachchh. He has been sent by King Jaysinhdev of Patan with a secret message for Kaak, the valiant chieftain of the city. The king seeks to urgently enlist Kaak's help in conquering the kingdom of Junagadh. However, Kaak has also received crucial summons from two others: Leeladevi, the firebrand princess whose marriage to Jaysinhdev Kaak himself facilitated; and Ranakdevi, the queen of Junagadh. Caught in a web of conflicting loyalties, Kaak must navigate a treacherous terrain of political machinations where the slightest misstep could lead to grave consequences-where even he will not emerge unscathed. K.M. Munshi's magnificent conclusion to his beloved Trilogy, The King of Kings is a panoramic epic filled with adventure and intrigue, and a timeless classic with a nuanced insight into human nature and the complex links between statecraft and violence."
Video Mariamman : and other stories,Imayam,"Description In his pathbreaking fiction, the acclaimed Tamil writer Imayam has written about the brutal complexities of the caste system and patriarchy in unadorned, powerful prose. Video Mariamman is a collection of fourteen of his finest stories. Poonkothai goes looking for her daughter who has eloped with a 'low-caste' man, hoping to give the daughter her certificates and some money so that she can lead a decent life. The 'Stolen Girl', born into a family of black magicians and abducted when she had barely reached puberty, grows up to be a tough survivor who lives life entirely on her own terms. Srinivasan, a police constable, tormented after being a pallbearer for a Dalit corpse and horrified by its implications for his social status, decides to quit his job. Chandravadanam, a music prodigy, dies, and Kalaiammal, who brought her up without ever entering her house, mourns her death and curses the man for whom she gave up her youth and music. In these and ten other stories-translated by Padma Narayanan with great skill and sensitivity-Imayam proves why he has been hailed as a writer with few equals anywhere, for his deep humanism and fierce sense of justice."

"Religion and women in India : gender, faith, and politics : 1780s-1980s","Sarkar, Tanika","In Religion and Women in India, Tanika Sarkar provides an account of gender prescriptions and proscriptions and their operation among various Indian religious communities, beginning with early British rule and concluding in the late twentieth century. Tracking various shifts and displacements in doctrinal thought and practice, she argues that Indian modernity was initiated largely through debates on gender, scripture, custom, and caste, which shaped ideal forms of masculine and feminine conduct. She demonstrates the organization of a modern public sphere around the controversies, cultural imaginaries, and political agitations over such issues as the age of consent, child marriage, widow remarriage, rape laws, and intercaste and interfaith relations. Gender norms are shown leaching into social attitudes, labor processes, and legal rights—leading eventually to modern Indian feminism. Closely analyzing the interpenetration and co-constitution of religion, politics, and gender in India, while also comparing parallel developments in Pakistan and Bangladesh, this pioneering work offers a brilliant and synthesizing account of the battles between orthodoxy and its opponents over two hundred years. No historian, no feminist, no student of politics can afford to miss it."

The book of disappearance,"Azem, Ibtisam","Alaa is haunted by his grandmother’s memories of being displaced from Jaffa and becoming a refugee in her homeland after the Nakba. Ariel, Alaa’s neighbour and friend, is a liberal Zionist, critical of the military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza yet faithful to the project of Israel. When he wakes up one morning to find that all Palestinians have suddenly vanished, Ariel begins searching for clues to the secret of their collective disappearance. That search, and Ariel’s reactions to it, intimately reveal the fissures at the heart of the Palestinian question. Between the stories of Alaa and Ariel are the people of Jaffa and Tel Aviv – café patrons, radio commentators, flower-cutters – against whose ordinary lives these fissures and questions play out. Critically acclaimed in Arabic, spare yet evocative, intensely intelligent in its interplay of perspectives, The Book of Disappearance is an unforgettable glimpse into contemporary Palestine as it grapples with both the memory of loss and the loss of memory."
The emperor's mirror : the state of research in India,"Bhaskara Rao, N.","'Independent and transparent research is vital for good governance. It can even safeguard against bad governments, ' writes Dr N. Bhaskara Rao, a pioneer in social research and countrywide surveys. In this book, backed by over five decades of experience, he then goes on to show how such research has declined in India from the golden period of the first few decades after Independence. He tracks the turns that social and policy research has taken over the last 70 years-slipping from a position of rare professional integrity and credibility to a worrying low in both role and status. The reasons, he shows-all of them interrelated- are the preoccupation of recent political regimes with polarization and populism, the egotism of powerful leaders, majoritarian trends in society and politics, lack of financial independence or immoderate pursuit of profit and corporate agendas. If this trend is not reversed, he argues, research could become irrelevant and even dangerously misleading, thus undermining our wellbeing as a nation. Timely, insightful, full of scores of concrete examples and informed by extraordinary professionalism and commitment to democracy, this is an essential book for everyone concerned with India and its all-round, inclusive development."

To be or not to be sociological : methodological ways of seeing,"Pathak, Dev Nath","What does it mean to be sociological? This is not a rhetorical question since it leads to unearthing the prevalent ways of seeing in the discipline of sociology, taking notes of the content and discontent, disputes and debates. Intellectual theatrics embedded in sociology, philosophy, and history of sciences, helmed with insights and enchantment, compel us to treat methodology as a dramatically invigorating field of perceptions and practices. This book marshals such varied materials to wishfully unsettle the gingerly settled debates to curate ruptures for further explorations. Experience thus becomes an intriguing episteme and knowledge, a reflexive endeavour. The message writ large is that methodology is not, and shall not be, a finished product unless parochialism and progress have become synonymous in sociology in India and South Asia."
Under the eye of the big bird : a novel,"Kawakami, Hiromi","SHORTLISTED FOR THE INTERNATIONAL BOOKER PRIZE From one of Japan's most brilliant and sensitive contemporary novelists, this speculative fiction masterpiece envisions an Earth where humans are nearing extinction, and rewrites our understanding of reproduction, ecology, evolution, artificial intelligence, communal life, creation, love, and the future of humanity In the distant future, humans are on the verge of extinction and have settled in small tribes across the planet under the observation and care of ""Mothers."" Some children are made in factories, from cells of rabbits and dolphins; some live by getting nutrients from water and light, like plants. The survival of the race depends on the interbreeding of these and other alien beings--but it is far from certain that connection, love, reproduction, and evolution will persist among the inhabitants of this faltering new world. Unfolding over fourteen interconnected episodes spanning geological eons, at once technical and pastoral, mournful and utopic, Under the Eye of the Big Bird presents an astonishing vision of the end of our species as we know it."

The text includes more than 80 carefully designed exercises with worked solutions available to instructors, applied problems from key scenarios, and suggestions for further reading, facilitating a practical and expansive learning experience. Suitable for senior undergraduate and graduate students in physics, engineering, and computer science, Building Quantum Computers is an invaluable resource for this emerging field."
Classical music of India : a practical guide,"Subramaniam, L.","About the Book A REVISED, EXPANDED AND UPDATED EDITION FROM ACCLAIMED MUSICIANS, L. SUBRAMANIAM AND VIJI SUBRAMANIAM. Indian classical music is the oldest, most sophisticated and scientifically complete musical system in the world. Its two major streams—the south Indian (Carnatic) and the north Indian (Hindustani)—share common origins and were part of a single tradition until the thirteenth century. L. Subramaniam, one of the best-known classical musicians of our age, and the late and highly celebrated vocalist Viji Subramaniam examine the origins, history, structure and spirit of this system in this book. Classical Music of India discusses in depth the melodic and rhythmic aspects of both Carnatic and Hindustani, briefly comparing these concepts with the classical music of Europe. There is a lucid comparison of the two Indian forms, an examination of instruments integral to them and a re-examination of fundamental concepts. An expanded, revised and updated reissue of the classic Euphony, this work is a definitive appraisal of Indian classical music. It is an essential addition to the library of any serious music lover, whether steeped in the music of India or new to it."

Stages on life's way : studies by various persons,"Kierkegaard, Soren","Stages on Life's Way, the sequel to Either/Or, is an intensely poetic example of Kierkegaard's vision of the three stages, or spheres, of existence: the esthetic, the ethical, and the religious. With characteristic love for mystification, he presents the work as a bundle of documents fallen by chance into the hands of ""Hilarius Bookbinder,"" who prepared them for printing. The book begins with a banquet scene patterned on Plato's Symposium. (George Brandes maintained that ""one must recognize with amazement that it holds its own in this comparison."") Next is a discourse by ""Judge William"" in praise of marriage ""in answer to objections."" The remainder of the volume, almost two-thirds of the whole, is the diary of a young man, discovered by ""Frater Taciturnus,"" who was deeply in love but felt compelled to break his engagement. The work closes with a letter to the reader from Taciturnus on the three ""existence-spheres"" represented by the three parts of the book. Stages on Life's Way not only repeats themes, characters, and pseudonymous authors of the earlier works but also goes beyond them and points to further development of central ideas in Concluding Unscientific Postscript."

The shortest history of Israel and Palestine,"Scott-Baumann, Michael","The century-old conflict between Israel and Palestine is one of the most bitter struggles in history, with profound consequences around the globe. In this accessible history, Michael Scott-Baumann succinctly describes its causes and charts its history from civil war to the present day. Adopting a distinct approach, each chapter starts with a lucid explanation of the politics and ends with personal testimony from interviews and memoirs of Palestinians and Israelis whose lives have been marked by conflict. By presenting competing interpretations from both sides, Scott-Baumann examines the key flashpoints of the twentieth century, including the early role of the British, the circumstances surrounding the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948, and the dramatic impact of the Six-Day War of 1967. The latter part of the book focuses on the nature of Israeli control of the Palestinian territories, and Palestinian resistance to it—which goes to the heart of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in recent decades. The result is an indispensable historical account, including analysis of why efforts to restore peace have continually failed. Peace, Scott-Baumann concludes, will be contingent on both sides having a right to self-determination."
"Gandhi and Tagore : politics, truth and conscience","Mukherji, Gangeya","This book brings together the political thought of Gandhi and Tagore to examine the relationship between politics, truth and conscience. It explores truth and conscience as viable public virtues with regard to two exemplars of ethical politics, addressing in turn the concerns of an evolving modern Indian political community. The comprehensive and textually argued discussion frames the subject of the validity of ethical politics in inhospitable contexts such as the fanatically despotic state and energised nationalism. The book studies in nuanced detail Tagore’s opposition to political violence in colonial Bengal, the scope of non-violence and satyagraha as recommended by Gandhi to Jews in Nazi Germany, his response to the complexity of protest against the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, and the differently constituted nationalism of Gandhi and Tagore. It presents their famous debate in a new light, embedded within the dynamics of cultural identification, political praxis and the capacity of a community to imbibe the principles of ethical politics. Comprehensive and perceptive in analysis, this book will be a valuable addition for scholars and researchers of political science with specialisation in Indian political thought, philosophy and history. Gangeya Mukherji is Reader in English at Mahamati Prannath Mahavidyalaya, Mau-Chitrakoot, Uttar Pradesh, India."
Social network analysis,"Chakraborty, Tanmoy","Ideas about social structure and social networks are very old. People have always believed that biological and social links among individuals are important. But it wasn't until the early 1930s that systematic research that explored the patterning of social ties linking individuals emerged. And it emerged, not once, but several times in several different social science fields and in several places. This book reviews these developments and explores the social processes that wove all these ""schools"" of network analysis together into a single coherent approach."
Classic case studies in psychology,"Rolls, Geoff","The human mind is both extraordinary and compelling. From the leader who convinced his followers to kill themselves to the man who lost his memory, these famous accounts have provided invaluable insights for scholars and researchers and amazed the public at large. Brought to life by Rolls, each case is contextualized with more typical behaviour, while the latest thinking in each subfield is also discussed. Revised and updated, this new edition features two new case studies including the 'Jim Twins' by Thomas Bouchard, an amazing case of twins separated at birth and adopted by different parents yet when reunited 30 years later shared so many behavioural characteristics. It also features a new issues and debates chapter. Classic Case Studies in Psychology is accessibly written and requires no prior knowledge of psychology, just an interest in the human condition. The book will amaze, sometimes disturb, but above all enlighten its readers. Geoff Rolls has taught psychology for over 26 years and is currently Head of Psychology at Peter Symonds College, Winchester, UK. He is the author of the popular Women Can’t Park, Men Can’t Pack (Chambers, 2009), which investigates gender stereotypes (including driving), and also Taking the Proverbial (Chambers, 2007), which explores the psychological truth behind well-known proverbs and sayings. ."

Fundamentals of corporate finance,"Berk, Jonathan","The best-selling Fundamentals of Corporate Finance (FCF) is written with one strongly held principle- that corporate finance should be developed and taught in terms of a few integrated, powerful ideas. As such, there are three basic themes that are the central focus of the book: 1) An emphasis on intuition--underlying ideas are discussed in general terms and then by way of examples that illustrate in more concrete terms how a financial manager might proceed in a given situation. 2) A unified valuation approach--net present value (NPV) is treated as the basic concept underlying corporate finance. Every subject covered is firmly rooted in valuation, and care is taken to explain how particular decisions have valuation effects. 3) A managerial focus--the authors emphasize the role of the financial manager as decision maker, and they stress the need for managerial input and judgment. The Eighth Edition continues the tradition of excellence that has earned Fundamentals of Corporate Finance its status as market leader. Every chapter has been updated to provide the most current examples that reflect corporate finance in today's world. The supplements package has also been updated and improved. From a new computerized test bank that is easier than ever to use, to new narrated PowerPoint for students, to new interactive learning modules, student and instructor support has never been stronger. There is also an optional, exciting new web-based program called McGraw-Hill's Homework Manager that will help your students learn corporate finance by duplicating problems from each chapter in the textbook and by providing automatic grading and feedback to both students and instructors."
The life and death of Mahatma Gandhi,"Payne, Robert","﻿This is the heroic story of the man whose non-violent movement transformed his native India both spiritually and politically as it impelled the nation along the road to independence. With consummate skill, in a narration that never flags in vividness and drama, Robert Payne re-creates Mahatma Gandhi both as a spiritual and historical force and as a living personality. When in January, l948, Gandhi was assassinated in Delhi by a fanatic, his death sent shock waves around the world. For two generations he had been the conscience of his country and the world. Planting the idea of non-violence firmly in men’s minds, he had not only conquered India but also changed the landscape of the human heart. In the tradition of his best-selling biographies of Lenin and Schweitzer, Robert Payne’s life brings Gandhi alive as a rounded personality. Beginning with the moving story of a shy, awkward boy from a provincial Indian city who married at Thirteen, then was separated from his bride for years while he read law in London, the book describes Gandhi’s life as a successful barrister in South Africa who turned his back on wealth to defend Indian settlers against discrimination and persecution. Robert Payne superbly describes Gandhi’s daring marches to aid the oppressed; his fasts and imprisonments; his historic achievements at international congresses and conferences in India and England where, clad only in shawl and loincloth, he met with prime ministers and viceroys and won their respect as he fought for the dignity and freedom of his people. “I would place Robert Payne’s book on the level of a great novel by Tolstoy, swiftly moving, panoramic, writ on the canvas of destiny and of close historical characterization,” writes Dr. Amiya Chakravarty, former private secretary of Rabindranath Tagore, who knew Gandhi personally and worked with him. “It is one of the great biographies. No finer account of Gandhi’s life and death has been written.”"

The hidden life of trees : a graphic adaptation,"Wohlleben, Peter","A STUNNING NEW GRAPHIC NOVEL, BRILLIANTLY ADAPTED FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES, WASHINGTON POST, AND WALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLER From “veritable tree whisperer” (WSJ) and internationally celebrated author Peter Wohlleben comes the long-awaited graphic novel adaptation of one of the most beloved books of our time. “Wohlleben has listened to trees and decoded their language. Now he speaks for them.” (NYRB) Filled with breathtaking illustrations and scientific facts about the forest and the flora and fauna who call it home—this eye-opening book will delight readers young and old. Are trees social beings? For forester Peter Wohlleben, the answer has always been yes, the forest is a social network. Trees live like human families: tree parents live together with their children, support them as they grow, share nutrients with those who are sick and struggling, and even warn each other of impending dangers. This vibrantly illustrated graphic novel follows Peter as its loveable main character, revealing the secret network of the forest and sharing struggles and triumphs from his career protecting trees. Told in Peter’s warm, conversational voice, not unlike that of a beloved grandfather chatting fireside, this visually stunning book offers scientific insights and pearls of wisdom gained from Peter’s decades of observing forests, including how trees impact weather and climate, how they communicate with each other, and how they interact with fungal networks deep within the ground. It also offers poignant memories from Peter’s personal life. Featuring 240 pages of full-color illustrations and text covering the entirety of The Hidden Life of Trees, this adaptation honors the spirit of the original book by seeking to change the way the world looks at trees, and will inspire generations of readers to celebrate the natural world and protect our last remaining forests before it’s too late."

Studies in the origins of Buddhism,"Pande, Govind Chandra","The present work is designed to consist of a group of organically connected historical studies relating to the origins of Buddhism. It is the doctrinal rather than the institutional aspect of Buddhism that is mainly considered. The subject matter is for the greater part of a literary and religious-philosophic character, but the treatment is intended to be primarily historical. The whole work attempts to trace the rise and evolution of early Buddhist literature and thought both as an inner cultural process and an external process of actions of individuals and monastic communities."
The Nature of Nature : The Metabolic Disorder of Climate Change.,"Shiva, Vandana","In an age of climate catastrophes and extinction, we need to turn back to nature and learn, once again, how to live sustainably on planet Earth—beginning with our relationship to food. Four billion years ago, Earth was a hot, lifeless planet. Through the process of evolution, the Earth and its diversity of living organisms gradually reduced the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. About 200,000 years ago, the conditions aligned for our own species—Homo sapiens—to emerge and thrive. But what will it take to continue to survive? In The Nature of Nature, world-renowned environmental thinker and activist Vandana Shiva argues that food is the currency of life, a thread woven throughout the web of all life, indivisible from Earth and its natural systems. When this interdependence is ruptured—as it is now—the conditions for the “metabolic disorder” of climate change and countless other ecological imbalances come into being. Proposals put forward by Big Ag and Big Tech to solve the intertwined climate and food crises will only exacerbate both. With clarity and a detailed analysis, Shiva unpacks the false promises made by technology-oriented, lab-intensive digital agriculture, revealing the dangers posed by fake and ultra-processed foods—dangers to the environment, to increasing greenhouse gas emissions, to the health of animals, and to our health and food security. In The Nature of Nature, Shiva takes a powerful stand, arguing with urgency and passion for a food and climate future based not on techno-optimism, hallucination, and corporate delusions, but on the natural regeneration of biodiversity in partnership with the biosphere. Praise for Vandana Shiva: “She’s been called the ‘Gandhi of grain,’ the ‘rock star’ of the anti-GMO movement and an ‘eco-warrior goddess.’ . . . Above all, [she] is a staunch believer that the food we eat matters. It makes us who we are, physically, culturally and spiritually.”—BBC"

On the meaning of the Mahabharata,"Sukthankar, Vishnu S.","It was in 1942 that the late Dr. V.S. Sukthankar was engaged to deliver four lectures on the 'Meaning of the Mahabharata' under the auspices of the University of Bombay. However, the fourth and last lecture was not delivered on account of his sad sudden demise on the morning of the day fixed for it. The Manuscript (Ms.) of these lectures-a veritable treasure to cherish had remained lost to the world of scholars for the long period of fifteen years. It bore the title ""Four Lectures on the Meaning of the Mahabharata."" This rather heavy-looking title has been abridged here in publication into the substantial title ""On the Meaning of the Mahabharata."" In a great many places, sentences or paragraphs have been placed in rectangular brackets in pencil. This bracketed material has been retained in the body of this book. Secondly, an alternative word or phrase is occasionally found written with a pencil in the margin along with an underscoring of the relevant word or words in the text. It is thought advisable to retain the text of the script as it stands, leaving such marginal alternatives alone. However, there is one exception: Dr. Sukthankar had rewritten in pencil almost a whole para at the end of the third lecture. This pencil-script is incorporated in the body of the book. A facsimile of this page is reproduced as the frontispiece. An English rendering of the German quotation from OLDENBURG is given in an Appendix for the convenience of the general reader. In Index, I Sanskrit quotations are printed in Devanagari for the benefit of those not quite conversant with the transliteration."
