The conference was sp- sored by Tsinghua University, National Science Foundation of China, Chinese Computer Federation, Toshiba Corporation, and NEC Software Chugoku, Ltd. PAKDD-99 provided an international forum for the sharing of original research results and practical development experiences among researchers and application developers from di?erent KDD-related areas such as machine lea- ing, databases, statistics, knowledge acquisition, data visualization, knowled- based systems, soft computing, and high performance computing. It followed the success of PAKDD-97 held in Singapore in 1997 and PAKDD-98 held in A- tralia in 1998 by bringing together participants from universities, industry, and government. PAKDD-99 encouraged both new theory/methodologies and real world - plications, and covered broad and diverse topics in data mining and knowledge discovery. The technical sessions included: Association Rules Mining; Feature Selection and Generation; Mining in Semi, Un-structured Data; Interestingness, Surprisingness, and Exceptions; Rough Sets, Fuzzy Logic, and Neural Networks; Induction, Classi?cation, and Clustering; Causal Model and Graph-Based Me- ods; Visualization; Agent-Based, and Distributed Data Mining; Advanced Topics and New Methodologies.

This technology aims at supporting the software production process by pro viding the means to model, analyse, improve, measure, and whenever it is reasonable and convenient, to automate software production activities. In recent years, this tech nology has proved to be effective in the support of many business activities not directly related to software production, but relying heavily on the concept of process (i. e. all the applications traditionally associated with workflow management). This book concentrates on the core technology of software processes, its principles and concepts as well as the technical aspect of software process support. The contributions to this book are the collective work of the Promoter 2 European Working Group. This grouping of 13 academic and 3 industrial partners is the suc cessor of Promoter, a working group responsible for creating a European software process community. Promoter 2 aims at exploiting this emerging community to collec tively develop remaining open issues, to coordinate activities and to assist in the dis semination of results. The title “Software Process Modelling and Technology” [Fink94] was produced during Promoter 1. Being “project based”, it presented the main findings and proposals of the different projects then being undertaken by the partners."

Its aim is to design and test concepts of Computer Supported Cooperative Work, especially concepts for workflow management systems, in order to fundamentally improve business processes in enterprises. Its methodological approach to analysis and design of cooperative networks is a response to shortcomings of current support systems and misunderstandings about cooperative work and team-based organisations. Several different commercial workflow management systems are presented and distinguished in terms of their main characteristics. Novel kinds of business process analysis are proposed, leading to interesting new combinations of information and cooperation technologies. The book not only presents ways to get around the pitfalls resulting from a naive use of these technologies, but also identifies design guidelines and critical success factors.""--PUBLISHER'S WEBSITE."

Translated into thirty languages, it has sold over ten million copies worldwide and lives on as a science book that continues to captivate and inspire new readers each year. When it was first published in 1988 the ideas discussed in it were at the cutting edge of what was then known about the universe. In the intervening twenty years there have been extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and macro-cosmic world. Indeed, during that time cosmology and the theoretical sciences have entered a new golden age . Professor Hawking is one of the major scientists and thinkers to have contributed to this renaissance."

In India, he is recognized as the Father of the Nation. A British-educated lawyer, Gandhi first employed his ideas of peaceful civil disobedience in the Indian community's struggle for civil rights in South Africa. Upon his return to India, he led nationwide campaigns for the alleviation of poverty, for the liberation of women, for brotherhood amongst differing religions, and ethnicities, for an end to untouchability and caste discrimination, and for the economic self-sufficiency of the nation, but above all for Swaraj-the independence of India from foreign domination."

Los costos de las computado-ras se han reducido en forma dramatica, debido al rapido desarrollo en la tecnologia de hardware y software. Las compu-tadoras que ocupaban grandes habitaciones y que costaban millones de dolares, hace algunas decadas, ahora pueden colocarse en las super cies de chips de silicio mas pequenos que una una, y con un costo de quiza unos cuantos dolares cada uno. (A esas enormes computadoras se les llamaba mainframes, y hoy en dia se utilizan ampliamente versiones actualizadas en los negocios, el gobierno y la industria.) Por fortuna, el silicio es uno de los materiales mas abundantes en el planeta (es uno de los ingredientes de la tierra comun). La tecnologia de los chips de silicio ha vuelto tan economica a la tecnologia de la computacion que cientos de millones de computadoras de uso general se encuentran actualmente ayudando a la gente de todo el mundo en empresas, en la industria, en el gobierno y en sus vidas. A traves de los anos, muchos programadores aprendieron la metodologia de programacion conocida como progra-macion estructurada. Usted aprendera tanto la programacion estructurada como la novedosa y excitante metodologia de la programacion orientada a objetos. ¿Por que ensenamos ambas? La orientacion a objetos es la metodologia clave de programacion utilizada hoy en dia por los programadores. Usted creara y trabajara con muchos objetos de software en este libro. Sin embargo, descubrira que la estructura interna de estos objetos se construye, a menudo, utilizando tecnicas de programacion estructurada. Ademas, la logica requerida para manipular objetos se expresa algunas veces mediante la programacion estructurada."

He critiques Western government, from imperialist foreign policies to the Clinton administration's promises to the poor. His judgment of the ""new world order"" foresees a growing abyss between the rich and poor, in the United States and internationally."

How can he make sense of violent acts, for himself and for his readers, without compromising its sheer excess and its meaning-defying core? How can he remain a scholarly observer when the country of his birth is engulfed by terror? These are some of the questions that engage Valentine Daniel in this exploration of life and death in contemporary Sri Lanka. In 1983 Daniel ""walked into the ashes and mortal residue"" of the violence that had occurred in his homeland. His planned project--the study of women's folk songs as ethnohistory--was immediately displaced by the responsibility that he felt had been given to him, by surviving family members and friends of victims, to recount beyond Sri Lanka what he had seen and heard there. Trained to do fieldwork by staying in one place and educated to look for coherence and meaning in human behavior, what does an anthropologist do when he is forced by circumstances to keep moving, searching for reasons he never finds? How does he write an ethnography (or an anthropography, to use the author's term) without transforming it into a pornography of violence? In avoiding fattening the anthropography into prurience, how does he avoid flattening it with theory? The ways in which Daniel grapples with these questions, and their answers, instill this groundbreaking book with a rare sense of passion, purpose, and intellect""--Publisher description."

Sorabji was India's first woman barrister. This is her autobiography from early childhood to adulthood. Written with a radically feminist perspective, it traces the author's self-development, and depicts the status and lifestyle of orthodox Hindu women, to the amelioration of whose legal and personal status she dedicated herself. This is an immensely readable book, full of wry humour. At the same time, addressing as it does a turbulent period of British rule in India, it deals with issues of colonialism, and questions of identity arising out of a complex racial, religious and cultural hybridity.""

She argues that philosophy has focused, mistakenly, on what it is right to do rather than good to be and that only by restoring the notion of ‘vision’ to moral thinking can this distortion be corrected. This brilliant work shows why Iris Murdoch remains essential reading: a vivid and uncompromising style, a commitment to forceful argument, and a courage to go against the grain."

Depuis Marx, en tout cas, dont la doctrine est d'ailleurs longuement examinée ici, la pensée politique et sociale n'avait rien produit en Occident de plus pénétrant et de plus prophétique. Simone Weil a elle-même considéré les Réflexions sur les causes de la liberté et de l'oppression sociale comme son oeuvre principale. Ce texte a été écrit en 1934."

As a study of magic in 'primitive' societies and its survival today in our thoughts and social actions, it represents what Claude Le;vi-Strauss called, in an introduction to that edition, the astonishing modernity of the mind of one of the century's greatest thinkers. The book offers a fascinating snapshot of magic throughout various cultures as well as deep sociological and religious insights still very much relevant today. At a period when art, magic and science appear to be crossing paths once again, A General Theory of Magic presents itself as a classic for our times.""--Back cover."

Significantly, Hayek challenged the general view among British academics that fascism was a capitalist reaction against socialism, instead arguing that fascism and socialism had common roots in central economic planning and the power of the state over the individual."

In time the lectures became a restatement of his theory of justice as fairness, revised in light of his more recent papers and his treatise Political Liberalism (1993). Rawls offers a broad overview of his main lines of thought and also explores specific issues never before addressed in any of his writings. He is well aware that since the publication of A Theory of Justice in 1971, American society has moved farther away from the idea of justice as fairness. Yet his ideas retain their power and relevance to debates in a pluralistic society about the meaning and theoretical viability of liberalism. This book demonstrates that moral clarity can be achieved even when a collective commitment to justice is uncertain"

John Maeda is an artist and a computer scientist, and he views the computer not as a substitute for brush and paint but as an artistic medium in its own right. Design By Numbers is a reader-friendly tutorial on both the philosophy and nuts-and-bolts techniques of programming for artists.Practicing what he preaches, Maeda composed Design By Numbers using a computational process he developed specifically for the book. He introduces a programming language and development environment, available on the Web, which can be freely downloaded or run directly within any JAVA-enabled Web browser. Appropriately, the new language is called DBN (for ""design by numbers""). Designed for ""visual"" people -- artists, designers, anyone who likes to pick up a pencil and doodle -- DBN has very few commands and consists of elements resembling those of many other languages, such as LISP, LOGO, C/JAVA, and BASIC.Throughout the book, Maeda emphasizes the importance -- and delights -- of understanding the motivation behind computer programming, as well as the many wonders that emerge from well-written programs. Sympathetic to the ""mathematically challenged,"" he places minimal emphasis on mathematics in the first half of the book. Because computation is inherently mathematical, the books second half uses intermediate mathematical concepts that generally do not go beyond high-school algebra. The reader who masters the skills so clearly set out by Maeda will be ready to exploit the true character of digital media design."

Drawing on insights from social studies of technology, gender studies and the sociology of consumption, Valuing Technology opens up new directions in the analysis of sociotechnical change within organisations. Based on a major research project focused upon the introduction of management of information systems in health, higher education and retailing, It explores the active role of end-users in innovation.This book argues that it is through the , often difficult, engagement between users and technology that new computer systems come to gain value within organisations. Key themes developed through analysis of case studies include:the valuing of technology via the on-going construction of needs, uses and utilitiesoccupational identities, organisational inequalities and technological changethe gendering of technological and organisational changeinterpretive flexibility and the 'stabilisation' of technological systems and their incorporation into the lives of people in organisations.A stimulating blend of the theoretical and substantive, this book demands a radical redefinition of 'technology acquisition'. It's highly original approach makes Valuing Technology essential reading for students, lecturers and researchers within the fields of organisation studies and the sociology of technology."

This new, revised edition of Erwin H. Ackerknecht's classic volume is now available in paperback, making the book especially suitable for classroom use. In twenty short chapters, Ackerknecht traces the fascinating saga of man's progress in the science and art of medicine, from primitive times through early civilizations, classical antiquity, the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and into the mid-twentieth century. The struggles and triumphs of some of history's most renowned medical pioneers -- Hippocrates, Harvey, Jenner, Osler, and many more -- are here, but this is not a catalog of individual accomplishments. Ackerknecht strikes a balance between the history of medicine and its social and cultural background; between medical science and medical practice; and between clinical and preventative medicine, illuminating not only the world of medicine but the position of medicine in the world. - Back cover."

These men and women regarded themselves as professional anti-witches, who (in dream-like states) apparently fought ritual battles against witches and wizards, to protect their villages and harvests. If they won, the harvest would be good, if they lost, there would be famine. The inquisitors tried to fit them into their pre-existing images of the witches' sabbat. The result of this cultural clash which lasted over a century, was the slow metamorphosis of the benandanti into their enemies - the witches. The author shows clearly how this transformation of the popular notion of witchcraft was manipulated by the Inquisitors, and disseminated all over Europe and even to the New World. The peasants' fragmented and confused testimony reaches us with immediacy, enabling the reader to identify a level of popular belief which constitutes a valuable witness for the reconstruction of the peasant way of thinking of this age."

Linear equations are treated via Hermite normal forms, which provides a successful and concrete explanation of the notion of linear independence. Another highlight is the connection between linear mappings and matrices, leading to the change of basis theorem which opens the door to the notion of similarity. The authors are well known algebraists with considerable experience of teaching introductory courses on linear algebra to students at St Andrews.

In this book, the author the scientist, and the critic come together to provide a concise, accessible account of what his work has taught him about biology and about its relevance to human affairs. In the process, he exposes some of the common and troubling misconceptions that misdirect and stall our understanding of biology and evolution. The central message of this book is that we will never fully understand living things if we continue to think of genes, organisms, and environments as separate entities, each with its distinct role to play in the history and operation of organic processes. Here Lewontin shows that an organism is a unique consequence of both genes and environment, of both internal and external features. Rejecting the notion that genes determine the organism, which then adapts to the environment, he explains that organisms, influenced in their development by their circumstances, in turn create, modify, and chose the environment in which they live."

Schrödinger's lecture focused on one important question: ""how can the events in space and time which take place within the spatial boundary of a living organism be accounted for by physics and chemistry?"" In the book, Schrödinger introduced the idea of an ""aperiodic crystal"" that contained genetic information in its configuration of covalent chemical bonds. In the 1950s, this idea stimulated enthusiasm for discovering the genetic molecule and would give both Francis Crick and James Watson initial inspiration in their research."

The motivations of the participants and the long-term repercussions of the trial have been the subject of intense and unresolved controversy, which still has resonances in our own time.

It can also be used to solve difference equations. The present text, while mathematically rigorous, is readily accessible to students of either mathematics or engineering. Even the Dirac delta function, which is normally covered in a heuristic fashion, is given a completely justifiable treatment in the context of the Riemann-Stieltjes integral, yet at a level an undergraduate student can appreciate. When it comes to the deepest part of the theory, the Complex Inversion Formula, a knowledge of poles, residues, and contour integration of meromorphic functions is required. To this end, an entire chapter is devoted to the fundamentals of complex analysis. In addition to all the theoretical considerations, there are numerous worked examples drawn from engineering and physics. When applying the Laplace transform, it is important to have a good understanding of the theory underlying it, rather than just a cursory knowledge of its application. This text provides that understanding."

The first is that almost nobody understands calculus fully the first time around: multiple exposures are required. The second belief is that graphing calculators can be used to make the introduction of the theory of limits much easier for the students. This book presents the theoretical pieces of introductory calculus, using appropriate technology, in a style suitable to accompany almost any first calculus text. It offers a large range of increasingly sophisticated examples and problems to build understanding of the notion of limit and other theoretical concepts. It is aimed at students who will study fields in which the understanding of calculus as a tool is not sufficient. The text uses the ""spiral approach"" of teaching, returning again and again to difficult topics, anticipating such returns across the calculus courses in preparation for the first analysis course.

With the development of computing has come an awakening of interest in algorithms. Often neglegted by historians and modern scientists, more concerned with the nature of concepts, algorithmic procedures turn out to have been instrumental in the development of fundamental ideas: practice led to theory just as much as the other way round. The purpose of this book is to offer a historical background to contemporary algorithmic practice. Each chapter centres around a theme, more or less in chronological order, and the story is told through the reading of over 200 original texts, faithfully reproduced. This provides an opportunity for the reader to sit alongside such mathematicians as Archimedes, Omar Khayyam, Newton, Euler and Gauss as they explain their techniques.

It turns an anthropological eye on the growing phenomenon of cyberspace to address some of the pressing questions of the Computer Age: How significant are the social practices which emerge from our increasing use of advanced information technology? Are the cultural infrastructures of cyberspace destined to be the primary arena of human activity in the future? And what are the possibilities and dangers that arise from our use and misuse of computer culture? Arguing that humans have always been technological as well as cultural beings, David Hakken calls for a fundamental rethinking of the traditional separation of anthropology and technical studies. Drawing on three decades of research on contemporary technological societies, this book outlines a fresh way of thinking about technology and offers an ethical and political response to the challenge of truly living as ""cyborgs"" in the age of cyberspace."

Yet even the World Wide Web, which allows almost any computer to read and display another computer's documents, has only increased the amount of printing done by computer users. The use of e-mail in an organization increases paper consumption by an average of 40 percent. In The Myth of the Paperless Office, Abigail Sellen and Richard Harper study paper usage as a way to understand the work that people do and the reasons they do it the way they do. Using the tools of ethnography and cognitive psychology, they look at paper use from the level of the individual up to that of organizational culture.""--BOOK JACKET"

It has produced men and women who have made outstanding contributions across the range of civilised human behaviour, and played a crucial part in the rise of two other great religions - Buddhism and Sikhism. Julius Lipner was born and raised in India and is able to draw on his own experience of Hindu beliefs and practices to explain what it means to be Hindu in a changing world. Hindus examines the religion as a plural phenomenon - that is, as a family of religions rather than a monolithic entity. The approach is thematic, and the author considers various topicssuch as the status of women - in more than one place and from more than one angle. He also tells and sometimes analyses Hindu stories, stressing the narrative quality of Hindu religion and giving us an insight into the nature of the Hindu phenomenon itself."

In this hypothetical situation, which corresponds to the state of nature in social contract theory, no one knows his or her place in society; his or her class position or social status; his or her fortune in the distribution of natural assets and abilities; his or her intelligence, strength, and the like; or even his or her conception of the good. Thus, deliberating behind a veil of ignorance, people determine their rights and duties. The first section of A Theory of Justice addresses objections to the theory and discusses alternative positions, especially utilitarianism. Rawls then applies his theory to the  philosophical basis of constitutional liberties, the problem of distributive justice, and the grounds and limits of political duty and obligation. He includes here a discussion of civil disobedience and conscientious objection. Finally, he connects his theory of justice with a doctrine of the good and of moral development. This enables him to formulate a conception of society as a social union of social unions, and to use his theory of justice to explain the values of community. Since its first appearance in 1971, A Theory of Justice has been continuously taught and debated, and translated into twenty-four languages. This revised edition includes changes, discussed in the preface, which Rawls considered to be significant, especially to the discussions of liberty and primary social goods. - Back cover."

It was published in English in 1975 by Beacon Press, translated and with an introduction by Thomas McCarthy. It was originally published by Suhrkamp. The title refers to a decline in the confidence of administrative functions, institutions, or leadership: a legitimation crisis. The direct translation of its German title is Legitimation Problems in Late Capitalism. In this book, published five years after Knowledge and Human Interests, Habermas explored the fundamental crisis tendencies in the state-managed capitalism. Before the state-managed capitalism, states are primarily concerned with maintaining the market economy, while in the state-managed capitalism, states have additional roles such as providing a social healthcare, pensions, educations, and so on. The expanded scopes of state administrations and influence helped managing crisis tendency of capitalism in economic field, but it created another crisis tendency in political as well as social-cultural field, which is legitimation crisis and motivation crisis, respectively."

During this period, American mathematical research enjoyed an unprecedented expansion, fueled by the technological successes of World War II and the postwar boom in federal funding for education in the sciences. Yet women's share of doctorates earned in mathematics in the United States reached an all-time low."

Yet it is also a philosophical enterprise in the way it represents the world and creates and manipulates models of reality, people, and action. In this book Paul Dourish addresses the philosophical bases of human-computer interaction. He looks at how what he calls ""embodied interaction""--An approach to interacting with software systems that emphasizes skilled, engaged practice rather than disembodied rationality - reflects the phenomenological approaches of Martin Heidegger, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and other twentieth-century philosophers. The phenomenological tradition emphasizes the primacy of natural practice over abstract cognition in everyday activity. Dourish shows how this perspective can shed light on the foundational underpinnings of current research on embodied interaction. He looks in particular at how tangible and social approaches to interaction are related, how they can be used to analyze and understand embodied interaction, and how they could affect the design of future interactive systems.""--Jacket."

Offering engaging anecdotes about historical figures, retellings of legendary events, and descriptive pieces - in sum: amusement, information, and variety - Aelian's collection of nuggets and narratives could be enjoyed by a wide reading public. A rather similar book had been published in Latin in the previous century by Aulus Gellius; Aelian is a late, perhaps the last, representative of what had been a very popular genre."" ""Here then are anecdotes about the famous Greek philosophers, poets, historians, and playwrights; myths instructively retold; moralizing tales about heroes and rulers, athletes and wise men; reports about styles in dress, foods and drink, lovers, gift-giving practices, entertainments, religious beliefs and death customs; and comments on Greek painting. Some of the information is not preserved in any other source. Underlying it all are Aelian's Stoic ideals as well as this Roman's great admiration for the culture of the Greeks (whose language he borrowed for his writings).""--BOOK JACKET."

This imaginative, powerful, and stylistically brilliant work not only brought the insights of Neo-Darwinism to a wide audience, but galvanized the biologycommunity, generating much debate and stimulating whole new areas of research. Forty years later, its insights remain as relevant today as on the day it was published."

On a return trip, after a futile attempt to discover the Northwest Passage, Cook was killed in what modern anthropologists and historians interpret as a ritual sacrifice of the fertility god. Questioning the circumstances surrounding Cook's so-called divinity - or apotheosis - and his death, Gananath Obeyesekere debunks one of the most enduring myths of imperialism, civilization, and conquest: the notion that the Western civilizer is a god to savages. Through a close reexamination of Cook's grueling final voyage, his increasingly erratic behavior, his strained relations with the Hawaiians, and the violent death he met at their hands, Obeyesekere rewrites an important segment of British and Hawaiian history in a way that challenges Eurocentric views of non-Western cultures."" ""The discrepancies between Cook the legend and the person come alive in a narrative based on shipboard journals and logs kept by the captain and his officers. In these accounts Obeyesekere sees Cook as both the self-conscious civilizer and as the person who, his mission gone awry, becomes a ""savage"" himself - during the last voyage it was Cook's destructive side that dominated. After examining various versions of the ""Cook myth,"" the author argues that the Hawaiians did not apotheosize the captain but revered him as a chief on par with their own. The blurring of conventional distinctions between history, hagiography, and myth, Obeyesekere maintains, requires us to examine the presuppositions that go into the writing of history and anthropology.""--Jacket."

Pertanto molte storie dell'estetica avevano preso in scarsa considerazione le teorie del bello e dell'arte elaborate prima di questa data, e l'epoca medievale è stata per lungo tempo una vittima illustre di questo equivoco. Ma da più di cinquant'anni l'atteggiamento degli storici è mutato e il Medioevo è stato riscoperto come un'epoca ricca di speculazioni affascinanti sulla bellezza, il piacere estetico, il gusto, il bello naturale e artistico, i rapporti tra l'arte e le altre attività umane. Questo volume racconta, in modo accessibile anche al lettore non specialista, le tappe di un dibattito che dalla Patristica, attraverso l'alto Medioevo sino agli albori del Rinascimento, presenta aspetti drammatici e avvincenti e che ci permette di capire meglio la mentalità, il gusto, gli umori dell'uomo medievale."

16-02-2002,2243,Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action,9.78075E+12,"Habermas, Jurgen",,"Cambridge: Polity Press,",1992,225 p.;,302 HAB,"This long-awaited book sets out the implications of Habermas's theory of communicative action for moral theory. ""Discourse ethics"" attempts to reconstruct a moral point of view from which normative claims can be impartially judged. The theory of justice it develops replaces Kant's categorical imperative with a procedure of justification based on reasoned agreement among participants in practical discourse.Habermas connects communicative ethics to the theory of social action via an examination of research in the social psychology of moral and interpersonal development. He aims to show that our basic moral intuitions spring from something deeper and more universal than contingent features of our tradition, namely from normative presuppositions of social interaction that belong to the repertoire of competent agents in any society."

Die ersten drei Beiträge reagieren auf neuere Versuche einer Rückkehr zu metaphysischen Denkformen. Die Aufsätze, die die pragmatische Wende in der Sprachanalyse nachvollziehen, entfalten den Begriff der kommunikativen Vernunft im Kontext zeitgenössischer Bedeutungs- und Handlungstheorien. Dasselbe Thema behandelt der siebte Beitrag aus größerer Distanz, und zwar in Auseinandersetzung mit den kontextualistischen Varianten einer heute dominierenden Vernunftkritik. In den beiden letzten Beiträgen werden zwei Fäden aus diesem Argumentationsgewebe aufgenommen und fortgesponnen: einmal geht es um das Problem der Unaussprechlichkeit des Individuellen, zum anderen um die Frage, warum philosophische Texte, ungeachtet ihres wesentlich rhetorischen Charakters, nicht in Literatur aufgehen."

Zunächst leistet sie einen Beitrag zur Bedeutungstheorie. Wir verstehen einen Sprechakt, wenn wir wissen, was ihn akzeptabel macht. Ferner stellt sich die Theorie des kommunikativen Handelns die Aufgabe, die in die kommunikative Alltagspraxis eingelassene Vernunft aufzusuchen und aus der Geltungsbasis der Rede einen unverkürzten Begriff der Vernunft zu rekonstruieren. Schließlich nimmt die Theorie des kommunikativen Handelns bestimmte kritische Anstöße auf, die seit Humboldt (bis zu Austin und Rorty) von Seiten der Sprachphilosophie ausgegangen sind. Sie kritisiert die einseitige Ausrichtung der abendländischen Philosophie an der Welt des Seienden."

26-02-2002,2347,Information Visualization,9.7802E+12,"Spence, Robert",,"New York: Addison-Wesley,",2001,206 p. ;,006.6 SPE,"Information visualization is the act of gaining insight into data, and is carried out by virtually everyone. It is usually facilitated by turning data – often a collection of numbers – into images that allow much easier comprehension. Everyone benefits from information visualization, whether internet shopping, investigating fraud or indulging an interest in art. So no assumptions are made about specialist background knowledge in, for example, computer science, mathematics, programming or human cognition.  Indeed, the book is directed at two main audiences. One comprises first year students of any discipline. The other comprises graduates – again of any discipline – who are taking a one- or two-year course of training to be visual and interaction designers. By focusing on the activity of design the pedagogical approach adopted by the book is based on the view that the best way to learn about the subject is to do it, to be creative: not to prepare for the ubiquitous examination paper.  The content of the book, and the associated exercises, are typically used to support five creative design exercises, the final one being a group project mirroring the activity of a consultancy undertaking a design (not an implementation) for a client. Engagement with the material of this book can have a variety of outcomes. The composer of a school newsletter and the applicant for a multi-million investment should both be able to convey their message more effectively, and the curator of an exhibition will have new presentational techniques on their palette.  For those students training to be visual/interaction designers the exercises have led to original and stimulating outcomes."

Why Read the Classics? is the most comprehensive collection of Calvino's literary criticism available in English, accounting for the enduring importance to our lives of crucial writers of the Western canon. Here--spanning more than two millennia, from antiquity to postmodernism--are thirty-six immediately relevant, elegantly written, accessible ruminations on the writers, poets, and scientists who meant most to Calvino at different stages of his life.Following the title essay, which explores fourteen definitions of ""the classic,"" Calvino offers writings that are at once critical appraisals and personal appreciations of, among others: Homer, Xenophon, Ovid, Pliny, Nezami, Ariosto, Cardano, Galileo, Defoe, Voltaire, Diderot, Ortes, Stendhal, Balzac, Dickens, Flaubert, Tolstoy, Twain, Henry James, Stevenson, Conrad, Pasternak, Gadda, Montale, Hemingway, Ponge, Borges, and Queneau.At a time when the Western canon and the very notion of ""literary greatness"" have come under increasing disparagement by the vanguard of so-called multiculturalism, Why Read the Classics? gives us an inspiriting corrective.From the Hardcover edition."

Her name is Wild Woman, but she is an endangered species. Though the gifts of wildish nature come to us at birth, society's attempt to ""civilize"" us into rigid roles has plundered this treasure, and muffled the deep, life-giving messages of our own souls. Without Wild Woman, we become over-domesticated, fearful, uncreative, trapped. Clarissa Pinkola Estes, Ph.D., Jungian analyst and cantadora storyteller, shows how woman's vitality can be restored through what she calls ""psychic archeological digs"" into the ruins of the female unconscious. In Women Who Run with the Wolves, Dr. Estes uses multicultural myths, fairy tales, folk tales, and stories chosen from over twenty years of research that help women reconnect with the healthy, instinctual, visionary attributes of the Wild Woman archetype. Dr. Estes collects the bones of many stories, looking for the archetypal motifs that set a woman's inner life into motion. In Women Who Run with the Wolves, Dr. Estes has created a lexicon for describing the female psyche. Fertile and life-giving, it s a psychology of women in the truest sense, a knowing of the soul."

And without mathematics our understanding of the universe would be vastly impoverished. But where did this nothing, this hollow circle, come from? And what, exactly, does it mean? For Kaplan, the history of zero is a lens for looking not only into the evolution of mathematics but into very nature of human thought. He points out how the history of mathematics is a process of recursive abstraction: how once a symbol is created to represent an idea, that symbol itself gives rise to new operations that in turn lead to new ideas. The beauty of mathematics is that even though we invent it, we seem to be discovering something that already exists. The joy of that discovery shines from Kaplan's pages, as he ranges from Archimedes to Einstein, making fascinating connections between mathematical insights from every age and culture.--From publisher description."

S.",,"New York: Cambridge University Press,",2000,142 p.;,800 LEW,"""Professor Lewis believed that literature exists above all for the joy of the reader and that books should be judged by the kind of reading they invite. He doubted the use of strictly evaluative criticism, especially its condemnations. Literary criticism is traditionally employed in judging books, and 'bad taste' is thought of as a taste for bad books. Professor Lewis' experiment consists in reversing the process, and judging literature itself by the way men read it. He defined a good book as one which can be read in a certain way, a bad book as one which can only be read in another. He was therefore mainly preoccupied with the notion of good reading: and he showed that this, in its surrender to the work on which it is engaged, has something in common with love, with moral action, and with intellectual achievement. In good reading we should be concerned less in altering our own opinions than in entering fully into the opinions of others; ""in reading great literature I become a thousand men and yet remain myself"". As with all that Professor Lewis wrote, the arguments are stimulating and the examples apt""--Publisher description."

First of all it is a point of intersection between religion and science. Demonic magic invokes evil spirits and rests upon a network of religious beliefs and practices, while natural magic exploits ""occult"" powers within nature and is essentially a branch of medieval science. Yet demonic and natural magic are not always as distinct in fact as they seem in principle. Even when magic is clearly nondemonic it sometimes mingles elements of religion and science: a magical cure, for example, may embody both herbal lore from folk medicine and phrases of prayer from Christian ritual. Secondly, magic is an area where popular culture meets with learned culture. Popular notions of magic got taken up and interpreted by ""intellectuals"" - a term here used for those with philosophical or theological education - and their ideas about magic, demons, and kindred topics were in turn spread throughout the land by preachers. One of the most important tasks in cultural history is working out these lines of transmission. Thirdly, magic represents a particularly interesting crossroads between fiction and reality. The fictional literature of medieval Europe sometimes reflected the realities of medieval life, sometimes distorted them, sometimes provided escapist release from them, and sometimes held up ideals for reality to imitate. When this literature featured sorcerers, fairies, and other workers of magic, it may not have been meant or taken as totally realistic. Even so, the magic of medieval literature did resemble the magical practices of medieval life in ways that are difficult but interesting to disentangle""--"

He deals with all the basic concepts of modern physics: elementary particles, black holes, gravity, quantum theory, time, mass, relativity and energy; this new edition also includes coverage of more recently emerging ideas including strings, imaginary time and chaos. Ridley's clear and witty account gives an exciting introduction to the non-specialist while offering a fresh perspective to scientists themselves."

His notions of communicative action and rationality have exerted a profound influence within philosophy and the social sciences. This volume examines the historical and intellectual contexts out of which Habermas' work emerged, and offers an overview of his main ideas, including those in his most recent publication. Amongst the topics discussed are his relationship to the Frankfurt School of critical theory and Marx, his unique contributions to the philosophy of the social sciences, the concept of 'communicative ethics', and the critique of post-modernism. New readers and non-specialists will find this the most convenient, accessible guide to Habermas currently available. Advanced students will find a conspectus of recent developments in the interpretation of Habermas."

How does 'sexuality' come into being and what connections does it have with the changes that have affected personal life on a more general plane? In answering these questions, Anthony Giddens disputes many of the dominant interpretations of the role of sexuality in modern culture. The emergence of what the author calls plastic sexuality - sexuality freed from its intrinsic relation to reproduction - is analysed in terms of the long-term development of the modern social order and social influences of the last few decades. Giddens argues that the transformation of intimacy, in which women have played the major part, holds out the possibility of a radical democratization of the personal sphere.""

28-03-2002,2636,Weight of the World,9.7808E+12,"Bourdieu, Pierre",,"London: Polity Press,",1999,646 p.;,301 BOU,"""Confined to their governmental ivory towers, and with their eyes fixed on the opinion polls, politicians and state officials are all too often oblivious to the lives of their citizens. On the other hand, the ordinary men and women who have so much hardship in their lives, and so few means to make themselves heard, either protest outside the official frameworks or remain locked in the silence of their despair. Under the direction of Pierre Bourdieu, a team of sociologists spent three years analysing the new forms of social suffering that characterize contemporary societies - the suffering of those who are denied the means of acquiring a socially dignified existence, as well as the suffering of those who are poorly adjusted to the rapidly changing condition of their lives. Declining housing estates, the school, the family, street-level state services, the everyday world of social workers and policemen, factory workers and white-collar clerks, the universe of farmers and artisans, of teachers and the unemployed and partly employed: these are just some of the spaces where conflict occurs, where specific discriminations and recriminations, tensions and contradictions abound and accumulate, and where new forms of suffering are produced. This book can be read like a series of short stories - the story of a steelworker who was laid off after twenty years in the same factory and who now struggles to support his family on unemployment benefits and a part-time job; the story of a trade unionist who finds his goals undermined by the changing nature of work; the story of a family from Algeria living on a housing estate on the outskirts of Paris whose members have to cope with pervasive, everyday forms of racism; the story of a schoolteacher confronted with urban violence; and many others as well.""--Book cover."

In the introduction to the work, Said explains his focus on the novel: he ""consider[s] it the aesthetic object whose connection to the expanding societies of Britain and France is particularly interesting to study. The prototypical modern realistic novel is Robinson Crusoe, and certainly not accidentally it is about a European who creates a fiefdom for himself on a distant, non-European island."""

The aim of a course in real analysis should be to challenge and improve mathematical intuition rather than to verify it. The philosophy of this book is to focus attention on questions which give analysis its inherent fascination. Does the Cantor set contain any irrational numbers? Can the set of points where a function is discontinuous be arbitrary? Can the rational numbers be written as a countable intersection of open sets? Is an infinitely differentiable function necessarily the limit of its Taylor series? Giving these topics center stage, the motivation for a rigorous approach is justified by the fact that they are inaccessible without it."

A well thought-out strategy of trade-offs between compilers and computer architectures is the key to the successful designing of highly efficient and effective computer systems. From embedded micro-controllers to large-scale multiprocessor systems, it is important to understand the interaction between compilers and computer architectures. The goal of the Annual Workshop on Interaction between Compilers and Computer Architectures (INTERACT) is to promote new ideas and to present recent developments in compiler techniques and computer architectures that enhance each other's capabilities and performance. Interaction Between Compilers and Computer Architectures is an updated and revised volume consisting of seven papers originally presented at the Fifth Workshop on Interaction between Compilers and Computer Architectures (INTERACT-5), which was held in conjunction with the IEEE HPCA-7 in Monterrey, Mexico in 2001. This volume explores recent developments and ideas for better integration of the interaction between compilers and computer architectures in designing modern processors and computer systems. Interaction Between Compilers and Computer Architectures is suitable as a secondary text for a graduate level course, and as a reference for researchers and practitioners in industry."

It is not only for professional philosophers, but for those engaged in what Deleuze called the ""nonphilosophical understanding of philosophy"" in other domains, such as the arts, architecture, design, urbanism, new technologies, and politics. For Deleuze's philosophy is meant to go off in many directions at once, opening up zones of unforeseen connections between disciplines."" ""Rajchman isolates the logic at the heart of Deleuze's philosophy and the ""image of thought"" that it supposes. He then works out its implications for social and cultural thought, as well as for art and design - for how to do critical theory today. In this way he clarifies the aims and assumptions of a philosophy that looks constantly to invent new ways to affirm the ""free differences"" and the ""complex repetitions"" in the histories and spaces in which we find ourselves. He looks at the particular realism and empiricism that this affirmation implies and how they might be used to diagnose new forces confronting us today. In the process, he explores the many connections that Deleuze himself constructs in working out his philosophy, with the arts, political movements, even the neurosciences and artificial intelligence.""--BOOK JACKET."

How is this affecting language? There is a widespread view that as 'technospeak' comes to rule, standards will be lost. In this book, David Crystal argues the reverse: that the Internet has encouraged a dramatic expansion in the variety and creativity of language. Covering a range of Internet genres, including e-mail, chat, and the Web, this is a revealing account of how the Internet is radically changing the way we use language. This second edition has been thoroughly updated to account for more recent phenomena, with a brand new chapter on blogging and instant messaging. Engaging and accessible, it will continue to fascinate anyone who has ever used the Internet."

Still without competition nearly a decade later, this new edition brings you up to speed on recent developments, while adding useful exercises and over 30% new material. It continues to emphasize the basic elements of the methodology, discussing in a remarkably clear and informal style both algorithmic and classical methods as well as modern applications.    The Probabilistic Method, Second Edition begins with basic techniques that use expectation and variance, as well as the more recent martingales and correlation inequalities, then explores areas where probabilistic techniques proved successful, including discrepancy and random graphs as well as cutting-edge topics in theoretical computer science. A series of proofs, or ""probabilistic lenses,"" are interspersed throughout the book, offering added insight into the application of the probabilistic approach. New and revised coverage includes:   Several improved as well as new results   A continuous approach to discrete probabilistic problems   Talagrand's Inequality and other novel concentration results   A discussion of the connection between discrepancy and VC-dimension   Several combinatorial applications of the entropy function and its properties   A new section on the life and work of Paul Erd's-the developer of the probabilistic method"

Bourdieu develops a forceful critique of traditional approaches to language, including the linguistic theories of Saussure and Chomsky and the theory of speech-acts elaborated by Austin and others. He argues that language should he viewed not only as a means of communication but also as a medium of power through which individuals pursue their own interests and display their practical competence.""--"

Yet what has emerged since the initial phase of Derrida’s influence on the study of English literature, classed under the rubric of deconstruction, has often been disowned by Derrida. What, then, can Derrida teach us about literary language, about the rhetoric of literature, and about questions concerning style, form, and structure?The Derrida Reader draws together a number of Derrida’s most interesting and idiosyncratic essays that treat literary language, the idea of the literary, and questions of poetics and poetry. The essays discuss single tropes or concepts, a figure such as metaphor, the ideas of titles and signatures, proper names, and Derrida’s thinking on such subjects as undecidability or aporia. The editor’s introduction is a demonstration in practice of how Derrida reads and how he adapts the act of reading to the text or figure in question. The introduction also outlines each essay’s main points, its usefulness for reading literary texts, and its particular area of interest. The Derrida Reader thus provides students of literature with a focused, contextualized, and readily understandable volume."

Bauman explores the silences found in debates about the Holocaust, and asks what the historical facts of the Holocaust tell us about the hidden capacities of present-day life. He finds great danger in such phenomena as the seductiveness of martyrdom; going to extremes in the same of safety; the insidious efects of tragic memory, and efficient, ""scientific"" implementation of the death penalty. Bauman writes, ""Once the problem of the guilt of the Holocaust perpetrators has been by and large settled and with the passing of time lost a good deal of its urgency and practical edge, the one big remaining question is the innocence of all the rest- not the least innocence of ourselves.""--publisher description."

He holds the chair in sociology at the prestigious Collège de France, yet his influence extends far beyond the area of sociological research and theory. Bourdieu's work, presented in over twenty books,lies on the borders of philosophy, anthropology and ethnology, and cultural theory. The present volume consists of diverse individual texts, produced between 1980 and 1986, which take two forms: interviews in which Bourdieu confronts a series of probing and intelligent interviewers, and conference papers that clarify and extend specific areas of his current research. Now that Bourdieu's work has achieved wide diffusion and celebrity, this is an appropriate time for this volume, a pause for retrospection and resynthesis, for correction of misreadings and extension of previous insights, and for projection of the next stages of his work. For this English edition, Bourdieu's celebrated inaugural lecture at the Collège de France, Leçon sur la Leçon, has been added. Because of the verve and clarity of Bourdieu's arguments in this book, it is a very readable and concise introduction to his work."

When trying to make sense of our lives, we tend to blame our own failings and weaknesses for our discomforts and defeats. And in doing so, we make things worse rather than better. Reasonable beings that we are, how does this happen and why does it go on happening?"" ""These are the questions addressed in this new book by Zygmunt Bauman - one of the most original and perceptive social thinkers writing today. For Bauman, the task of sociology is not to censor or correct the stories we tell of our lives, but to show that there are more ways in which our life stories can be told. By bringing into view the many complex dependencies invisible from the vantage point of private experience, sociology can help us to link our individual decisions and actions to the deeper causes of our troubles and fears - to the ways we live, to the conditions under which we act, to the socially drawn limits of our imagination and ambition. Sociology can help us to understand the processes that have shaped the society in which we live today, a society in which individualization has become our fate. And sociology can also help us to see that if our individual but shared anxieties are to be effectively tackled, they need to be addressed, collectively, true to their social, not individual, nature.""

Drawing on hundreds of e-mails among Microsoft executives, trial testimony, and exclusive interviews with Gates and his chief lieutenants, Wall Street Journal reporter David Bank reveals the bitter maneuvering between what he calls Microsoft's ""Windows hawks"" and its ""Internet doves. On one side were the fierce defenders of the hegemony of Windows, on the other those who championed a new way of doing business based on the Internet's ""open standards."" The reformers wanted to break free from the legacy of Windows and dare to compete on the merits of their software. At the center of this pitched battle stood Gates, the tactical genius who had created the company in his own image and who now accepts full responsibility for his fateful choices. ""Every mistake you can lay at my feet,"" he told Bank, who takes him at his word, offering a critique of Gates's leadership not from the perspective of government prosecutors or envious software rivals but from inside the company itself.""--[book jacket]."

Beginning with an analysis of an essay on the sacred by Czech philosopher/human rights activist Jan Patocka, Derrida follows the development of moral and ethical responsibility, and the concept of the soul's immortality, in the transition from Platonism to Christianity. He then ponders the self's anticipation of death in sacrifice, war, orgiastic mystery cults, murder and execution, with reference to Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling, Nietzsche, Heidegger's thought (a constant attempt to separate itself from Christianity'') and the biblical story of Abraham's contemplated sacrifice of his son, Isaac, at God's behest. In the most provocative section, Derrida links religious injunctions of sacrifice to themonotonous complacency'' of modern society, which allows tens of millions of children to die of hunger and disease."

""Professor Taylor relates Hegel to the earlier history of philosophy and, more particularly, to the central intellectual and spiritual issues of his own time. He sees these in terms of a pervasive tension between the evolving ideals of individuality and self-realization on the one hand, and on the other a deeply-felt need to find signifance in a wider community. He considers the present form of these issues and the significance of Hegel's enterprise for the development of philosophy in this century."" ""Hegel's basic ideas are characterized against this background, followed by an extensive exposition of his philosophy, as it is developed in the Phenomenology, the Logic and the works on history, politics, art, religion and the history of philosophy. Professor Taylor engages with Hegel sympathetically, on Hegel's own terms and, as the subject demands, in detail. We are made to grasp the interconnections of the system without being overwhelmed or overawed by its technicality. We are shown its importance and its limitations, and are enabled to stand back from it. - Publisher."

He's also developing the science that will transform history, and ultimately pit him against future history's most awesome threat.Isaac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy is one of the high-water marks of science fiction.  It is the monumental story of a Galactic Empire in decline, and the secret society of scientists who seek to shorten the inevitable Dark Age with the science of psychohistory.  Now, with the permission -- and blessing -- of the Asimov estate, the epic saga continues.Fate -- and a cruel Emperor's arbitrary power -- have thrust Hari Seldon into the First Ministership of the Empire against his will. As the story opens, Hari is about to leave his quiet professorship and take on the all but impossible task of administering 25 million inhabited worlds from the all-steel planet of Trantor.  With the help of his beautiful bio-engineered ""wife"" Dors and his alien companion Yugo, Seldon is still developing the science that will transform history, never dreaming that it will ultimately pit him against future history's most awesome threat."

His earlier publications have shown how dramatic British innovations in India, including revenue and legal systems, led to fundamental structural changes in Indian social relations. This collection of his writings in the last fifteen years discusses areas in which the colonial impact has generally been overlooked. The essays form a multifaceted exploration of the ways in which the British discovery, collection, and codification of information about Indian society contributed to colonial cultural hegemony and political control. -- Publisher description."

""In this biography Michel Surya enters into a complicity with Bataille's oeuvre to provide a detailed exposition of its themes as they developed against the backdrop of his life. The essence of Bataille's life and work were defined by transience and effacement, reflecting a will both to contest the impermanence of things and to confront death. His troubled childhood, his relationships with surrealism and his paradoxical position at the heart of twentieth-century French thought are enriched here with testimonies from Bataille's closest acquaintances, making this a vivid and detailed study. Revealing the context in which he worked, and the ways in which his work and ideas took shape, Surya sheds light on a figure Foucault described as 'one of the most important writers of the century.'""--BOOK JACKET."

It begins with the theory of holographic imaging, the characteristics of the reconstructed image, and the various types of holograms. Practical aspects of holography are then described, including light sources, the characteristics of recording media and recording materials, as well as methods for producing different types of holograms and computer-generated holograms. Finally, important applications of holography are discussed, such as high-resolution imaging, holographic optical elements, information processing, and holographic interferometry. The book includes comprehensive reference sections and appendices summarizing some useful mathematical results. Numerical problems with their solutions are provided at the ends of chapters. This is an invaluable resource for advanced undergraduate and graduate students as well as researchers in science and engineering who would like to learn more about holography and its applications in science and industry."

In order to simplify building software that performs robustly regardless of platform or network infrastructure, a new strata of 'middleware' has been created. This book provides a conceptual framework within which to describe object-oriented middleware for the integration of distributed objects. UML is used to explain distributed systems concepts. Presenting both an extended case study and smaller illustrative examples, there are plenty of coded examples in Java, C++, CORBA IDL and Microsoft IDL, which reflect the reality of today's multi-language heterogeneous systems. This is a book for developers who are new to programming in distributed environments. It also supports a variety of courses where the central theme is object-oriented development with middleware technologies. The book shows the middleware concepts and p..."

Baudrillard classifies the everyday objects of the 'new technical order' as functional, nonfunctional and metafunctional. He contrasts 'modern' and 'traditional' functional objects, subjecting home furnishing and interior design to a celebrated semiological analysis."

These problems, all of which lend themselves to extensive computational exploration, live at the interface of analysis, combinatorics and number theory so the techniques involved are diverse. A main computational tool used is the LLL algorithm for finding small vectors in a lattice. Many exercises and open research problems are included. Indeed one aim of the book is to tempt the able reader into the rich possibilities for research in this area. Peter Borwein is Professor of Mathematics at Simon Fraser University and the Associate Director of the Centre for Experimental and Constructive Mathematics. He is also the recipient of the Mathematical Association of Americas Chauvenet Prize and the Merten M. Hasse Prize for expository writing in mathematics."

You just have to have the right intuition. In this lively look at both subjects, David Williams convinces mathematics students of the intrinsic interest of statistics and probability, and statistics students that the language of mathematics can bring real insight and clarity to their subject. He helps students build the intuition needed, in a presentation enriched with examples drawn from all manner of applications, e.g., genetics, filtering, the Black–Scholes option-pricing formula, quantum probability and computing, and classical and modern statistical models. Statistics chapters present both the Frequentist and Bayesian approaches, emphasising Confidence Intervals rather than Hypothesis Test, and include Gibbs-sampling techniques for the practical implementation of Bayesian methods. A central chapter gives the theory of Linear Regression and ANOVA, and explains how MCMC methods allow greater flexibility in modelling. C or WinBUGS code is provided for computational examples and simulations. Many exercises are included; hints or solutions are often provided."

It lays the necessary groundwork by differentiating networked learning from related concepts such as e-learning and technology-enhanced learning, and situating technological progress within the larger context of social change. From there, the most salient questions relating to infrastructures and institutions are analyzed, including challenges for the university, the role of affordance in digital educational design, whether networked learning has (or needs) its own pedagogy, and the wider political implications of networked learning. This synthesis transforms a wide-ranging and seemingly scattered multidisciplinary field into a cohesive, accessible, and operable whole. Featured among the topics: · Theories of learning in a digital age. · The significance of networked theories for networked learning. · Openness, open educational resources, and the university. · Cloud computing and hybrid infrastructures. · Pedagogy and the scholarship of teaching and learning. · Relationships between technology use in society and in education. Given its balance of theoretical and practical information and present-day and future-based insights, Networked Learning has considerable value for education researchers, educational technology researchers, teachers, policymakers, and students."

But then, says Moravec, a period of very comfortable existence will follow, as humans benefit from a fully automated economy. And eventually, as machines evolve far beyond humanity, robots will supplant us."

The breadth of the theory is matched by that of its applications, which include topics as diverse as codes, circuit design and algorithm complexity. It has thus become essential for workers in many scientific fields to have some familiarity with the subject. The authors have tried to be as comprehensive as possible, dealing in a unified manner with, for example, graph theory, extremal problems, designs, colorings and codes. The depth and breadth of the coverage make the book a unique guide to the whole of the subject."

CMOS, BiCMOS and bipolar ciruits are covered in depth, including state-of-the-art circuit structures. Recent advances in both the computer and telecommunications industries demand high-performance VLSI digital circuits. Digital processing of signals demands high-speed circuit techniques for the GHz range. The design of such circuits represents a great challenge; one that is amplified when the power supply is scaled down to 3.3 V. Moreover, the requirements of low-power/high-performance circuits adds an extra dimension to the design of such circuits. High-Performance Digital VLSI Circuit Design is a self-contained text, introducing the subject of high-performance VLSI circuit design and explaining the speed/power tradeoffs. The first few chapters of the book discuss the necessary background material in the area of device design and device modeling, respectively. High-performance CMOS circuits are then covered, especially the new all-N-logic dynamic circuits. Propagation delay times of high-speed bipolar CML and ECL are developed analytically to give a thorough understanding of various interacting process, device and circuit parameters. High-current phenomena of bipolar devices are also addressed as these devices typically operate at maximum currents for limited device area. Different, new, high-performance BiCMOS circuits are presented and compared to their conventional counterparts. These new circuits find direct applications in the areas of high-speed adders, frequency dividers, sense amplifiers, level-shifters, input/output clock buffers and PLLs. The book concludes with a few system application examples of digital high-performance VLSI circuits. Audience: A vital reference for practicing IC designers. Can be used as a text for graduate and senior undergraduate students in the area."

Although the laws of physics create a powerful impression that time is flowing, in fact there are only timeless `nows'. In The End of Time, the British theoretical physicist Julian Barbour describes the coming revolution in our understanding of the world: a quantum theory of the universe that brings together Einstein's general theory of relativity - which denies the existence of a unique time - and quantum mechanics - which demands one. Barbour believes that only the most radical of ideas can resolve the conflict between these two theories: that there is, quite literally, no time at all. The End of Time is the first full-length account of the crisis in our understanding that has enveloped quantum cosmology. Unifying thinking that has never been brought together before in a book for the general reader, Barbour reveals the true architecture of the universe and demonstrates how physics is coming up sharp against the extraordinary possibility that the sense of time passing emerges from a universe that is timeless. The heart of the book is the author's lucid description of how a world of stillness can appear to be teeming with motion: in this timeless world where all possible instants coexist, complex mathematical rules of quantum mechanics bind together a special selection of these instants in a coherent order that consciousness perceives as the flow of time. Finally, in a lucid and eloquent epilogue, the author speculates on the philosophical implications of his theory: Does free will exist? Is time travel possible? How did the universe begin? Where is heaven? Does the denial of time make life meaningless? Written with exceptional clarity and elegance, this profound and original work presents a dazzlingly powerful argument that all will be able to follow, but no-one with an interest in the workings of the universe will be able to ignore."

What difference could it make to our reading of literature? Terry Eagleton, one of the foremost critics of our generation, has some answers in this wonderfully clear and readable analysis. Sharp and concise, it is, without doubt, the most important work on literary criticism that has emerged out of the tradition of Marxist philosophy and social theory since the nineteenth century. For this Routledge Classics edition the author has written a startling and challenging new preface, which explains the continuing relevance of this pioneering work for the twenty-first century.

The 27-year-old Japanese scholar first visited the West in 1897 and over the course of the next seventy years became the world's leading authority on Zen. His radical and penetrating insights earned him many disciples, from Carl Gustav Jung to Allen Ginsberg, and from Thomas Merton to John Cage. In Mysticism: Christian and Buddhist Suzuki compares the teachings of the great Christian mystic Meister Eckhart with the spiritual wisdom of Shin and Zen Buddhism. By juxtaposing cultures that seem to be radically opposed, Suzuki raises one of the fundamental questions of human experience: at the limits of our understanding, is there an experience that is universal to all humanity? Mysticism: Christian and Buddhist is a book that challenges and inspires; it will benefit readers of all persuasions who seek to understand something of the nature of spiritual life.""--BOOK JACKET."

Powerful personal computers have resulted in an explosion of e-banking, e-commerce and e-mail, and as a consequence the encryption of communications to ensure security has become a matter of public interest and importance. This book describes and analyses many cipher systems ranging from the earliest and elementary to the most recent and sophisticated, such as RSA and DES, as well as wartime machines such as the ENIGMA and Hagelin, and ciphers used by spies. Security issues and possible methods of attack are discussed and illustrated by examples. The design of many systems involves advanced mathematical concepts and this is explained in detail in a major appendix. This book will appeal to anyone interested in codes and ciphers as used by private individuals, spies, governments and industry throughout history and right up to the present day.

Developing countries and those making a transition from socialism are particularly at risk. This book suggests how high levels of corruption limit investment and growth and lead to ineffective government. Corruption creates economic inefficiencies and inequities, but reforms are possible to reduce the material benefits from payoffs. Corruption is not just an economic problem, however; it is also intertwined with politics. Reform may require changes in both constitutional structures and the underlying relationship of the market and the state. Effective reform cannot occur unless both the international community and domestic political leaders support change."

Owning the most powerful computer, the latest high-tech gadget, and the whizziest website is a status symbol on a par with having a flashy car or a designer suit. And a media obsessed with the digital explosion has reappropriated the term ""computer nerd"" so that it's practically synonymous with ""entrepreneur."" Yet, a mere fifteen years ago, wireheads hooked on tweaking endless lines of code were seen as marginal weirdos, outsiders whose world would never resonate with the mainstream. That was before one pioneering work documented the underground computer revolution that was about to change our world forever."

Painting a compelling portrait of Microsoft's culture, this ready-to-use book encompasses the core principles that propel every Microsoft employee to excel and direct every manager's thought process. Turn to any page and you will find valuable practices and insights that can be applied to your own company.   Imagine how following these Microsoft standards could instantly increase your firm's productivity: Immediately after each project is completed, a ruthless ""post-mortem"" process ignores the project's successes to dissect its failures...and how they can be avoided in the future; Instead of wallowing in profit-induced security, Microsoft immediately begins to develop replacements for its cash-cow products - knowing that if they don't, the competition will; Smaller is not just better, it is essential, but work groups, while functionally independent, still pursue a common strategic plan; Could your company survive outside the 9-to-5 ritual? Find examples of how Microsoft's focus on task completion instead of time clocks leads to unmatched employee morale and superior effort.Can you honestly expect to build a company the size and strength of Microsoft? Possibly not...BUT by adapting Bill Gates's aggressive, common-sense strategies for use in your own company, you CAN position yourself for outstanding growth and success in today's intensely competitive, Microsoft-influenced marketplace."

A Bogota car mechanic sets up ""shop"" on a quiet side street. Four Mexican immigrants assemble semiconductors in a San Diego home. A Leningrad doctor sells needed medicine to a desperate patient. All are part of a growing worldwide phenomenon that is widely known but little understood. The informal or underground economy is thriving today, not only in the Third World countries where it was first reported and studied but also in Eastern Europe and the developed nations of the West. The Informal Economy is the first book to bring together studies from all three of these settings and to integrate them into a coherent theoretical framework. Taking an international perspective, the authors dispel a number of misconceptions about the informal economy. They make clear, for instance, that it is not solely a province of the poor. Cutting across social strata, it reflects a political and economic realignment between employers and workers and a shift in the regulatory mission of the government. Throughout, the authors' theoretical observations serve not only to unify material from diverse sources but also to map out directions for further research.""--Back cover."

A colaboration of ideas with director Stanley Kubrick in the late 1960's it begins at ""the dawn of man"" and then leaps to the year 2001 where a mission to Saturn (Jupiter in the film) is mounted to try and answer questions raised by the discovery of an ancient artifact dug up on the moon. Though not particularly fast paced, the science is good, and there are a few hair raising events. There are also interesting speculations about the future, such as the space shuttle, and a device eerily similar to an iPad. Leaving plenty of room for contemplation and the appreciation for the inevitable trials of space travel, this is one of the truly landmark pieces of hard science fiction."

This ironic perspective on the human condition is valuable on a private level, although it cannot advance the social or political goals of liberalism. In fact Rorty believes that it is literature not philosophy that can do this, by promoting a genuine sense of human solidarity. A truly liberal culture, acutely aware of its own historical contingency, would fuse the private, individual freedom of the ironic, philosophical perspective with the public project of human solidarity as it is engendered through the insights and sensibilities of great writers. The book has a characteristically wide range of reference from philosophy through social theory to literary criticism. It confirms Rorty's status as a uniquely subtle theorist, whose writing will prove absorbing to academic and nonacademic readers alike."

""At the heart of the drama is the spirit possession of a male actor by the fearsome warrior goddess Bhadrakali, an incarnation of Kali, in her divine battle with the demon king Darika. The goddess Bhadrakali is both violent and sexual, pock-marked yet beautiful, serene and powerfully destructive. Caldwell analyses how this powerful female energy is both unleashed - and contained - by the ritual drama, and is reflected in the daily lives of its performers and spectators."" ""From the psycho-sexual dynamics of male transvestite performance to a rigorous rethinking of contemporary anthropological practice, Caldwell weaves together a personal narrative of discovery with a scholarly critique of social and religious norms. Placing herself in a position of vulnerability vis-a-vis the people she studies, Caldwell takes a personal and academic risk that many advocate, yet few have carried out.""

This approach to the study of languages has been called a 'generative enterprise' and has revolutionzed our understanding of human languages and other cognitive systems."" ""This consists of the edited transcript of a lecture, delivered at the University of Delhi in Janurary 1996, where Chomsky reflected on the history of the enterprise and related it to some strikingly novel advances in recent grammatical theory called the 'Minimalist Programme'. Integrating philosophical and conceptual issues with empirical research, he sketched some of the key issues that have characterized generative grammar in recent years to chart out the agenda for future research in language theory."" ""The volume includes extensive clarificatory notes and references and a complete bibliography of Chomsky's publications on linguistics and cognitive theory.

Je veux montrer a mes semblables un homme dans toute la verite de la nature; et cet homme, ce sera moi. Moi seul. Je sens mon coeur, et je connais les hommes. Je ne suis fait comme aucun de ceux que j'ai vus; j'ose croire n'etre fait comme aucun de ceux qui existent. Si je ne vaux pas mieux, au moins je suis autre. Si la nature a bien ou mal fait de briser le moule dans lequel elle m'a jete, c'est ce dont on ne peut juger qu'apres m'avoir lu. Que la trompette du jugement dernier sonne quand elle voudra, je viendrai, ce livre a la main, me presenter devant le souverain juge. Je dirai hautement: Voila ce que j'ai fait, ce que j'ai pense, ce que je fus. J'ai dit le bien et le mal avec la meme franchise. Je n'ai rien tu de mauvais, rien ajoute de bon; et s'il m'est arrive d'employer quelque ornement indifferent, ce n'a jamais ete que pour remplir un vide occasionne par mon defaut de memoire. J'ai pu supposer vrai ce que je savais avoir pu l'etre, jamais ce que je savais etre faux. Je me suis montre tel que je fus: meprisable et vil quand je l'ai ete; bon, genereux, sublime, quand je l'ai ete: j'ai devoile mon interieur tel que tu l'as vu toi-meme. Etre eternel, rassemble autour de moi l'innombrable foule de mes semblables; qu'ils ecoutent mes confessions, qu'ils gemissent de mes indignites, qu'ils rougissent de mes miseres. Que chacun d'eux decouvre a son tour son coeur au pied de ton trone avec la meme sincerite, et puis qu'un seul te dise, s'il l'ose: je fus meilleur que cet homme-la."

In this book John Vardalas describes the quest for such competence in Canada, exploring the significant contributions of the civilian sector but emphasizing the role of the Canadian military in shaping radical technological change. As he shows, Canada's determination to be an active participant in research and development work on advanced weapons systems, and in the testing of those weapons systems, was a cornerstone of Canadian technological development during the years 1945-1980. Vardalas presents case studies of such firms as Ferranti-Canada, Sperry Gyroscope of Canada, and Control Data of Canada. In contrast to the standard nationalist interpretation of Canadian subsidiaries of transnational corporations as passive agents, he shows them to have been remarkably innovative and explains how their aggressive programs to develop all-Canadian digital R&D and manufacturing capacities influenced technological development in the United States and in Great Britain. While underlining the unprecedented role of the military in the creation of peacetime scientific and technical skills, Vardalas also examines the role of government and university research programs, including Canada's first computerized systems for mail sorting and airline reservations. Overall, he presents a nuanced account of how national economic, political, and corporate forces influenced the content, extent, and direction of digital innovation in Canada. - Publisher."

The era covered here starts with the gathering abundance of travel narratives and bestiaries and lapidaries, and goes through the ontological gerrymanderings of Bacon, Newton, and Descartes. It was during the 12th century, Daston and Park make abundantly clear, when early travel narratives and encyclopedias spread the word of strange and wondrous things to be found in the outlands, that unfamiliar objects and counterintuitive phenomena--visceral and vertiginous--began to hover at the edge of scientific inquiry, defining borders, goading further study. And for the next six centuries, except for a few moments of ridicule and rejection, wonders were embraced by natural philosophers and historians as sources of pleasure and delight, as wellsprings for curiosity; treasured by royalty and the court as unmediated contacts with another world, possession of which meant one was noble and cultivated, as rare and marvelous as the objects themselves. The authors situate wonders in the circular mental map of medieval geography, which had the wildest of the wilds at the margins and the Mediterranean at the center. They also detail the contexts that set the tone for the reception wonders had from the powers that were--the court, the Christian religious orders, the universities. That reception modulated between adulation and disdain as first rational explanation and then the search for universals, regularity, and causal knowledge took hold in a world that now took its cues from the secular and the empirical. An informed and original look at the role of wonder during a time when there was a whole lot to wonder about."

Understanding through seeing only seems to be an obviously intuitive process. Actually, developing the visual sense is something like learning a language, with its own special alphabet, lexicon, and syntax. People find it necessary to be verbally literate whether they are ""writers"": or not; they should find it equally necessary to be visually literate, ""artists"" or not. This primer is designed to teach students the interconnected arts of visual communication. The subject is presented, not as a foreign language, but as a native one that the student ""knows"" but cannot yet ""read."" The analogy provides a useful teaching method, in part because it is not overworked or too rigorously applied. This method of learning to see and read visual data has already been proved in practice, in settings ranging from Harlem to suburbia. Appropriately, the book makes some of its most telling points through visual means. Numerous illustrated examples are employed to clarify the basic elements of design (teach an alphabet), to show how they are used in simple syntactic combinations (""See Jane run.""), and finally, to present the meaningful synthesis of visual information that is a finished work of art (the apprehension of poetry...)."

It is no coincidence that the fundamental science of numbers has come to be known as the ""Queen of Mathematics."" Indeed some of the most complex conventions of the mathematical mind have evolved from the study of basic problems of number theory. André Weil, one of the outstanding contributors to number theory, has written an historical exposition of this subject; his study examines texts that span roughly thirty-six centuries of arithmetical work — from an Old Babylonian tablet, datable to the time of Hammurapi to Legendre’s Essai sur la Théorie des Nombres (1798). Motivated by a desire to present the substance of his field to the educated reader, Weil employs an historical approach in the analysis of problems and evolving methods of number theory and their significance within mathematics."

The text has a distinctly applied orientation and begins with a survey of number systems and elementary set theory. Included are discussions of scientific notation and the representation of numbers in computers. An introduction to set theory includes mathematical induction, and leads into a discussion of Boolean algebras and circuits. Relations and functions are defined. An introduction to counting, including the Binomial Theorem, is used in studying the basics of probability theory. Graph study is discussed, including Euler and Hamilton cycles and trees. This is a vehicle for some easy proofs, as well as serving as another example of a data structure. Matrices and vectors are then defined. The book concludes with an introduction to cryptography, including the RSA cryptosystem, together with the necessary elementary number theory, such as the Euclidean algorithm. Good examples occur throughout, and most worked examples are followed by easy practice problems for which full solutions are provided. At the end of every section there is a problem set, with solutions to odd-numbered exercises. There is a full index. A math course at the college level is the required background for this text; college algebra would be the most helpful. However, students with greater mathematical preparation will benefit from some of the more challenging sections."

Rather than giving a complete account of the subject, a few chosen examples are treated exhaustively. They not only reveal the bearing of Fibonacci numbers on mathematics, but also provide very readable marvels of mathematical reasoning.

More than just a list of predictions, Kurzweil's prophetic blueprint for the future guides us through the inexorable advances that will result in: computers exceeding the memory capacity and computational ability of the human brain by the year 2020 (with human-level capabilities not far behind); relationships with automated personalities who will be our teachers, companions, and lovers; and information fed straight into our brains along direct neural pathways.

We are rushing into a world where connectivity is everything, and where old business know-how means nothing.

In New Rules for the New Economy, Kelly presents ten fundamental principles of the connected economy that invert the traditional wisdom of the industrial world.Succinct and memorable, New Rules explains why these powerful laws are already hardwired into the new economy, and how they play out in all kinds of business--both low and high tech--all over the world. More than an overview of new economic principles, it prescribes clear and specific strategies for success in the network economy.

Twenty years, ago, Robert Putnam made a seemingly simple observation: once we bowled in leagues, usually after work; but no longer. This seemingly small phenomenon symbolized a significant social change that became the basis of the acclaimed bestseller, Bowling Alone, which The Washington Post called “a very important book” and Putnam, “the de Tocqueville of our generation.” Bowling Alone surveyed in detail Americans’ changing behavior over the decades, showing how we had become increasingly disconnected from family, friends, neighbors, and social structures, whether it’s with the PTA, church, clubs, political parties, or bowling leagues. In the revised edition of his classic work, Putnam shows how our shrinking access to the “social capital” that is the reward of communal activity and community sharing still poses a serious threat to our civic and personal health, and how these consequences have a new resonance for our divided country today. He includes critical new material on the pervasive influence of social media and the internet, which has introduced previously unthinkable opportunities for social connection—as well as unprecedented levels of alienation and isolation. At the time of its publication, Putnam’s then-groundbreaking work showed how social bonds are the most powerful predictor of life satisfaction, and how the loss of social capital is felt in critical ways, acting as a strong predictor of crime rates and other measures of neighborhood quality of life, and affecting our health in other ways. While the ways in which we connect, or become disconnected, have changed over the decades, his central argument remains as powerful and urgent as ever: mending our frayed social capital is key to preserving the very fabric of our society""--Simon & Schuster."

Keck and Kathryn Sikkink examine a type of pressure group that has been largely ignored by political analysts: networks of activists that coalesce and operate across national frontiers. Their targets may be international organizations or the policies of particular states. Historical examples of such transborder alliances include anti-slavery and woman suffrage campaigns. In the past two decades, transnational activism has had a significant impact in human rights, especially in Latin America, and advocacy networks have strongly influenced environmental politics as well. The authors also examine the emergence of an international campaign around violence against women."

Although it originated as a method to study general dynamical systems, it has found significant uses in coding for data storage and transmission as well as in linear algebra. This book is the first general textbook on symbolic dynamics and its applications to coding. It will serve as an introduction to symbolic dynamics for both mathematics and electrical engineering students. Mathematical prerequisites are relatively modest (mainly linear algebra at the undergraduate level) especially for the first half of the book. Topics are carefully developed and motivated with many examples. There are over 500 exercises to test the reader's understanding. The last chapter contains a survey of more advanced topics, and there is a comprehensive bibliography."

From the emergence of Apple Computer in the late 1970s and early 1980s to its current resurgence, charismatic leader Steve Jobs has captivated the public. Both revered and reviled for his dictatorial manner and stunning successes, Jobs has transcended his legend in Silicon Valley to take on some of the heaviest hitters in Hollywood. Now, in The Second Coming of Steve Jobs, Alan Deutschman presents the most revealing portrait yet of this fascinating, complex character--an in-depth look at the many layers of Steve Jobs, a man who is at turns a brilliant cult figure and an abusive, egomaniacal kid.This story begins back in 1985 when Jobs was exiled from Apple, and then it goes on to chronicle the rise and fall of his own company, NeXT; the enormous success of Jobs's film animation studio, Pixar; and finally his triumphant return to Apple in the late 1990s, with Jobs taking the title of CEO in January 2000. Displaying an uncanny skill at the negotiation table and an intuitive sense of brilliant design that could capture the public's fascination with products like the iMac, along with a celebrity's ability to command the spotlight, Jobs has been able to catapult himself to the top of the Silicon Valley and Hollywood establishments.Based on interviews with scores of people--rivals, colleagues, friends--who have worked with Jobs over the years, The Second Coming of Steve Jobs gets under the hood of this extraordinarily complex man: how and why he almost gave up on his career; the details of his negotiations with Disney's Jeffrey Katzenberg and Michael Eisner, and of the culture clash between Silicon Valley and Hollywood; his methods of leadership, management, creativity, and innovation; his friendship and rivalry with Bill Gates--and much more. In an unsentimental and powerful voice, Deutschman reveals a man who suffered his midlife crisis at thirty, compressing it into just three months; struggled between self-imposed exile and the allure of public life; and became the baby boomer icon who was constantly blurring the lines between businessman, rock star, and beatnik. The Second Coming of Steve Jobs is a compelling look at an individual who has changed the face of technology and entertainment for the twenty-first century. This candid account of Steve Jobs's tumultuous and provocative career will answer the many questions left unanswered by this incredibly private character who has come to represent the Silicon Valley American dream."

Error-correcting codes play a fundamental role in minimizing data corruption caused by defects such as noise, interference, crosstalk and packet loss. This book provides an accessible introduction to the basic elements of algebraic codes, and discusses their use in a variety of applications. The author describes a range of important coding techniques, including Reed-Solomon codes, BCH codes, trellis codes, and turbocodes. Throughout the book, mathematical theory is illustrated by reference to many practical examples. The book is aimed at graduate students of electrical and computer engineering, and at practising engineers whose work involves communications or signal processing."

Along the road readers will visit some exciting citadels in theoretical physics as the authors guide them through the strong and weak aspects of the various theoretical constructions. Our goal is to make clear the mutual coherence and to put each theoretical model in an appropriate perspective. The mere fact that so many partial solutions have been proposed to describe transport, be it in condensed matter, fluids, or gases, illustrates that we are entering a world of physics with a rich variety of phenomena. Theoretical physics always seeks to provide a unifying picture. By presenting this tour of many very inventive attempts to build such a picture, we hope that the reader is inspired and encouraged to help find the unifying principle behind the many faces of transport."

Thompson (1886-1946) through the letters they exchanged over almost 30 years. Based on a collection of letters, cablegrams and greeting cards, it provides new insights into the personalities of these two eminent individuals living and working in colonial Bengal. Tagore and Thompson met as poets in 1913 and became friends instantly, but their relationshup got strained soon after mainly due to personal failings."" ""Tagore won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1913 and the West feted him as a mystic poet from the East in line with their romantic stereotype about the Orient. Thompson disagreed with the West's representation of Tagore and sought to rectify it by writing two books on Tagore's life and work. He persisted in his criticism of both Tagore's English translations and his image in the West. Tagore was at first irked by these books but later admitted to the weakness of his translations. The letters between Tagore and Thompson are a window to those developments: of their instant intimate friendship, the stressful turn it took, and the reconciliation they reached. At a broader level, the book throws light on contemporary Indo-British cultural and political history.""--BOOK JACKET."

He feared the enthusiasm for his ideas tended to exceed a deeper understanding of his quest for truth rooted in devotion to God. His attempts to get closer to this divine power led him to seek purity through simple living, dietary practices, celibacy, and a life without violence. This is not a straightforward narrative biography, in The Story of My Experiments with Truth, Gandhi offers his life story as a reference for those who would follow in his footsteps."

It is a self-contained introduction to all basic results in the theory of information and coding (invented by Claude Shannon in 1948). This theory was developed to deal with the fundamental problem of communication, that of reproducing at one point, either exactly or approximately, a message selected at another point. There is a short and elementary overview introducing the reader to the concept of coding. Then, following the main results, the channel and source coding theorems, there is a study of specific coding schemes which can be used for channel and source coding. This volume can be used either for self-study, or for a graduate/undergraduate level course at university. It includes dozens of worked examples and several hundred problems for solution. The exposition will be easily comprehensible to readers with some prior knowledge of probability and linear algebra."

It provides extensive and up-to-date coverage of the fundamental algorithms for permutation groups with reference to aspects of combinatorial group theory, soluble groups, and p-groups where appropriate. The book begins with a constructive introduction to group theory and algorithms for computing with small groups, followed by a gradual discussion of the basic ideas of Sims for computing with very large permutation groups, and concludes with algorithms that use group homomorphisms, as in the computation of Sylowsubgroups. No background in group theory is assumed. The emphasis is on the details of the data structures and implementation which makes the algorithms effective when applied to realistic problems. The algorithms are developed hand-in-hand with the theoretical and practical justification. All algorithms are clearly described, examples are given, exercises reinforce understanding, and detailed bibliographical remarks explain the history and context of the work. Much of the later material on homomorphisms, Sylow subgroups, and soluble permutation groups is new.""--PUBLISHER'S WEBSITE."

The puzzlement arises when scientists have more than one answer, and disagree among themselves. This book helps people find their way through this maze of scientific contradiction and uncertainty. By acquainting them with the ways that uncertainty arises in science, how scientists accommodate and make use of uncertainty, and how they reach conclusions in the face of uncertainty, the book enables readers to confidently evaluate uncertainty from their own perspectives, in terms of their own experiences."

Individual chapters discuss the representativeness and availability heuristics, problems in judging covariation and control, overconfidence, multistage inference, social perception, medical diagnosis, risk perception, and methods for correcting and improving judgments under uncertainty. About half of the chapters are edited versions of classic articles; the remaining chapters are newly written for this book. Most review multiple studies or entire subareas of research and application rather than describing single experimental studies. This book will be useful to a wide range of students and researchers, as well as to decision makers seeking to gain insight into their judgments and to improve them."

It is an amusing and enlightening story of four characters who live in a ""Maze"" and look for ""Cheese"" to nourish them and make them happy. Two are mice named Sniff and Scurry. And two are ""little people"" -- beings the size of mice who look and act a lot like people. Their names are Hem and Haw. ""Cheese"" is a metaphor for what you want to have in life -- whether it is a good job, a loving relationship, money, possession, health, or spiritual peace of mind. And ""The Maze"" is where you look for what you want -- the organization you work in, or the family or community you live in. In the story, the characters are faced with unexpected change. Eventually, one of them deals with it successfully, and writes what he has learned from his experience on the maze walls. When you come to see ""The Handwriting on the Wall,"" you can discover for yourself how to deal with change, so that you can enjoy less stress and more success (however you define it) in your work and in your life. Written for all ages, the story takes less than an hour to read, but its unique insights can last for a lifetime. - Jacket flap."

Correspondingly, new areas of probability and statistics are being developed specifically to meet the needs of this area. There is now a necessity for a text that introduces probability and statistics in the bioinformatics context. This book also describes some of the main statistical applications in the field, including BLAST, gene finding, and evolutionary inference, much of which has not yet been summarized in an introductory textbook format. This book grew out of the bioinformatics courses given at the University of Pennsylvania. The material is, however, organized to appeal to biologists or computer scientists who wish to know more about the statistical methods of the field, as well as to trained statisticians who wish to become involved in bioinformatics. The earlier chapters introduce the concepts of probability and statistics at an elementary level. Later chapters should be immediately accessible to the trained statistician. Sufficient mathematics background consists of courses in calculus and linear algebra. The basic biological concepts that are used are explained, or can be understood from the context."

In a world in which Ken Starr can subpoena Monica Lewinsky?s bookstore receipts and deleted e-mail messages can be used as justification for firing employees, it?s clear that private information of all kinds can be taken out of context and wielded against us. Where exactly did our constitutional guarantees on privacy go? In superbly lucid prose, Jeffrey Rosen tells not only where those privacy rights went but also how we can get them back. The Unwanted Gaze is utterly indispensable for anyone who cares about the future of his or her private life."

With the recent explosive growth of wireless applications, smart antenna technology has achieved widespread commercial and military applications.  The only book available on the topic of adaptive antennas using digital technology, this text reflects the latest developments in smart antenna technology and offers timely information on fundamentals, as well as new adaptive techniques developed by the authors. Coupling electromagnetic aspects of antenna design with signal processing techniques designed to promote accurate and efficient information exchange, the text presents various mechanisms for characterizing signal-path loss associated with signal propagation, particularly for mobile wireless communications systems based on such techniques as joint space-frequency adaptive processing.  In clear, accessible language, the authors:   explain the difference between adaptive antennas and adaptive signal processing   Illustrate the procedures for adaptive processing using directive elements in a conformal array   clarify multistage analysis procedure which combines electromagnetic analysis with signal processing   present a survey of the various models for characterizing radio wave propagation in urban and rural environments   describe a method wherein it is possible to identify and eliminate multipath without spatial diversity   optimize the location of base stations in a complex environment  The text is an excellent resource for researchers and engineers working in electromagnetics and signal processing who deal with performance improvement of adaptive techniques, as well as those who are concerned with the characterization of propagation channels and applications of airborne phased arrays."

23-05-2003,6038,Combinatorics and graph theory,387987363,"Harris, John M.",,"New York: Springer-Verlag,",2000,225 p.;,511.6 HAR,"This book evolved from several courses in combinatorics and graph theory given at Appalachian State University and UCLA. Chapter 1 focuses on finite graph theory, including trees, planarity, coloring, matchings, and Ramsey theory. Chapter 2 studies combinatorics, including the principle of inclusion and exclusion, generating functions, recurrence relations, Pólya theory, the stable marriage problem, and several important classes of numbers. Chapter 3 presents infinite pigeonhole principles, König's lemma, and Ramsey's theorem, and discusses their connections to axiomatic set theory. The text is written in an enthusiastic and lively style. It includes results and problems that cross subdisciplines, emphasizing relationships between different areas of mathematics. In addition, recent results appear in the text, illustrating the fact that mathematics is a living discipline. The text is primarily directed toward upper-division undergraduate students, but lower-division undergraduates with a penchant for proof and graduate students seeking an introduction to these subjects will also find much of interest."

The conference, sponsored by the Datacard Group and Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, was held on October 1–3, 2002. Organizational support was provided by the Center for Cryptography, Computer and Network Security Center at the University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee. Organizing a conference is a major undertaking requiring the efforts of many individuals. The Conference President, Graham Higgins (Datacard Group), oversaw all arrangements for the conference, and the General Chair, Susan Thompson (Datacard Group), oversaw the local organization and registration. Local arrangements were directed by Jan Ward (Hewlett-Packard Laboratories) and Jamie Wilson (Datacard Group). Financial arrangements were managed by Natalie Churchill (Hewlett-Packard Laboratories). We wish to thank the organizers, without whose support this conference would not have been possible. This conference program included two keynote speakers: Bob Evans (Office of the e-Envoy) and Vic Maconachy (Department of Defense). The program committee considered 44 submissions of which 23 papers were accepted. Each submitted paper was reviewed by a minimum of three referees. These proceedings contain revised versions of the accepted papers. Revisions were not checked and the authors bear full responsibility for the content of their papers."

Using relevant biological examples, the book will provide background on and strategies for using many of the most powerful and commonly-used algorithms for sequence-based discovery. Given the explosion in the number of organisms whose genomes have been sequenced over the last several years, the emergence of new types of data sets (particularly those derived using next-generation sequencing technologies), and increasing emphasis on being able to make effective use of ""big data"", the book is both timely and important to investigators in molecular biology and related fields. With a full-color, enlarged page design, this edition offers the most readable, up-to-date, and thorough introduction to the field for biologists. The new ""Foundations"" section insures that readers have a firm understanding of the technologies that generate the data, as well as the essential statistical and programming tools. Features include special boxes, enhanced use of real examples, and problem sets with answers provided on the book's dedicated website (www.wiley.com/bioinformatics).

It is a story about the childhood experiences of fraternal twins whose lives are destroyed by the ""Love Laws"" that lay down ""who should be loved, and how. And how much."" The book explores how the small things affect people's behavior and their lives. The book also reflects its irony against casteism, which is a major discrimination that prevails in India. It won the Booker Prize in 1997."

The Cathars held revolutionary beliefs that threatened the authority of the Catholic Church as well as the legitimacy of feudal law:  They thought the idea of Hell to be a sham; they rejected all sacraments, including marriage; they thought private property an absurd notion and that all things worldly were corrupt; and they preached religious tolerance and equality of the sexes.Supported by the leaders of Languedoc, Catharism enraged the new and formidable pope, Innocent III, who was determined to flex the Church’s muscle after decades of ineffectual weakness.  Innocent resolved to eradicate what is now known as the Great Heresy.  He recruited the forces of France, eager to expand her territory to the south, to undertake a systematic extermination of the Cathars and their supporters through a series of crusades between 1209 and 1229.  By the time the wars were finally over, the ancient social fabric of the Languedoc had been destroyed, the territory of France reached as far as the Mediterranean, and a terrifying new force—the Inquisition—had been unleashed that would torment Europe for centuries.The Perfect Heresy eloquently chronicles the life and death of the Cathar movement—one of Western civilization’s most mind-boggling tales.  As he did in his highly praised Back to the Front, Stephen O’Shea brings long-ago events to life though the energy of his prose and the clarity of his insight.  Full of colorful and passionate personalities, his latest book sheds new light on the thirteenth century and on the timelessness of religious intolerance."

19-06-2003,6268,Security in computing,130355488,"Pfleeger, Charles P.",3rd ed.,"New Jersey: Prentice Hall,",2003,746 p.;,005.8 PFL,"This book offers complete coverage of all aspects of computer security, including users, software, devices, operating systems, networks, law, and ethics. Reflecting rapidly evolving attacks, countermeasures, and computing environments, it introduces up-to-the-minute best practices for authenticating users, preventing malicious code execution, using encryption, protecting privacy, implementing firewalls, detecting intrusions, and more. Cryptography is critical to computer security; it is an essential tool that students and professionals must know, appreciate and understand. But as with most tools, the user does not need to be a maker: using a screwdriver successfully is entirely separate from knowing how to forge the metal from which it is made. This edition will separate the use of cryptography from its underlying mathematical principles. It will introduce cryptography early in the book to provide a solid background on types of algorithms, appropriate uses of these different types, and advanced concepts such as digital signatures and cryptographic hash codes. It will also address how cryptography can fail. However, it will cover these topics without revealing the internals of cryptography; closer to the end of the book it will delve into the internals of specific algorithms. In this way, readers who want to know the details can study those (and can even read the later chapter early, out of the normal sequence), but it will not unnecessarily burden readers who, like most users, will never get closer to cryptography than an encrypt() function. One strength of SiC4 has been its sidebars. Readers enjoy the brief examples of real life exploits. Fortunately, the news is full of stories of security failures, and it is important to connect these actual events to the strong pedagogy of the book. ACS, which was organized around attacks of different types, include many timely incident stories that we can pull into SiC5. Cloud computing and mobile code and computing are not covered extensively in SiC4. Cloud computing appears as a six page interlude in ACS, but in the few years since ACS was written, the use of cloud computing has expanded, as well as the security ramifications. We intend to devote an entire chapter to cloud computing. Similarly, mobile code and mobile computing have grown. These topics appeared briefly in SiC4 and ACS, but we plan to expand mobile computing into its own chapter, as well. The topic progression of SiC4 largely followed its predecessor editions, back to the first edition (1988). In 1988 networking was certainly neither as important nor pervasive as it has become. Trying to defer all coverage of network topics until Chapter 7, its position in SiC4 delays important content significantly and, perhaps more importantly, makes for a long and broad network security chapter. In 1988 readers had less direct contact with a network than now, and these readers had limited experience using a network prior to reading the book. Obviously readers in 2014 come with vastly more network exposure. This exposure is an asset: Readers now can appreciate  a network-delivered attack even before they study network security. SiC5 will take advantage of readers' familiarity with networks, and present attacks delivered by a network-assisted attacker based on the primary source of vulnerability -- software, operating system, protocol, user error -- and not defer these topics to the networks chapter just because a network was involved in the attack. Finally, privacy has been an important topic in the book in early editions, and its importance and coverage have grown as well. The authors will again expand the coverage of privacy, expanding on topics such as web tracking and social networking. These additions cannot come without some pruning. Previously hot topics, such as trusted operating systems and multilevel databases, are being pared down. The authors will also reconsider topics such as economics and management which, although interesting and important, appeal to a relatively small target audience. - Publisher."

Practically anything--from creating """"photovore"""" robots that hunt light to feed their solar cells to making toasters announce, """"Your toast is ready!"""" These low-cost (around 7 bucks) computers-in-a-chip let electronics designers and hobbyists add intelligence, responsiveness, and functions that mimic big computers to any electronic product or project. And they not only do it more cheaply, """"they do it at least 20 faster and far less expensively than comparative Basic StampsTM!""""And they're just as easy to use. PIC Microcontroller Project Book gives you hands-on directions for putting Microchip's RISC-based chips with up to 8K of memory to work. Starting with simple projects and experiments, this book leads you gradually into sophisticated programming techniques. You need absolutely no programming experience to get started. John Iovine coaches you through every single step. Written with the beginner in mind, PIC Microcontroller Project Book gives you A-B-C guidance on how to:Get the equipment you  need (includes lists of suppliers).Program your chip, from plugging in the breadboard to running the compiler, with lines of code to copyMake your chip count numerically.Deliver messages on a liquid crystal display.Synthesize human speech.Control DC motors, stepper motors, and servos.Convert any analog signal to digital.Add sensing abilities to robots.Build decision-making neural and """"fuzzy logic"""" functions into your projects."""
