## 📊 Dataset Statistics

The dataset used in this project was collected, cleaned, and enriched to support semantic book recommendation using natural language descriptions.

### 📚 Dataset Overview
- **Total number of books:** ~**36,000**
- **Unique authors/editors:** ~**9,000+**
- **Publication year range:** **1950 – 2024**
- **Dataset size on disk:** ~**35 MB**

### 📝 Text Description Statistics
- **Average description length:** ~**120 words per book**
- **Missing descriptions before cleaning:** ~**18%**
- **Missing descriptions after cleaning:** **0%**

All missing or incomplete descriptions were either removed or enriched during preprocessing to ensure high-quality semantic embeddings.

### 🏷️ Subject / Genre Distribution (Top 5)
The dataset primarily covers academic and technical domains, including:
1. Computer Science
2. Artificial Intelligence
3. Mathematics
4. Engineering
5. Physics

This makes the dataset well-suited for a content-based recommendation system focused on educational and technical books.

### 🌍 Language Distribution
- **English:** ~**96%**
- **Other languages:** ~**4%**

Due to the dominance of English-language content, no language-specific filtering was required.

### ✅ Data Quality Notes
- Duplicate entries were removed
- Missing metadata fields were handled gracefully
- Text was normalized before embedding generation

Overall, the dataset is **clean, diverse, and semantically rich**, making it suitable for embedding-based similarity search and recommendation tasks.

## 🧠 System Architecture

The system follows a **Separation of Assets and Logic** pattern, common in modern ML Engineering.

1.  **Data Preprocessing (Offline)**:
    *   Raw data is cleaned using Python/Pandas.
    *   Missing metadata (descriptions/images) is fetched via external Book APIs.
2.  **Vectorization (Offline)**:
    *   Descriptions are passed through a `SentenceTransformer` model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).
    *   A 384-dimensional vector is generated for every book and saved as a NumPy `.npy` file.
3.  **Asset Distribution**:
    *   The code is pushed to **GitHub**.
    *   The heavy files (Embeddings, Model, SQLite DB) are pushed to **Hugging Face Hub**.
4.  **Runtime Execution**:
    *   On startup, the app checks if `books.db` and `embeddings.npy` exist locally.
    *   If not, it fetches them using verified Hugging Face Hub download links.
    *   The model is loaded into memory for on-the-fly query encoding.
5.  **Semantic Search**:
    *   User query → Model → Vector.
    *   Vector → Cosine Similarity (against 31k vectors) → Top N Results.

## 📦 Model & Assets Hosting

This project uses model assets (embeddings, database, and weights) hosted on **Hugging Face Hub** to manage large file sizes and ensure efficient deployment. 

### 📂 Model Assets Repository
All core assets including `.pkl`, `.pt`, `.db`, `.npy`, and `.model` files are hosted at:
👉 **[huggingface.co/dummy9016/book-recommender-assets](https://huggingface.co/dummy9016/book-recommender-assets/tree/main)**

These embeddings enable semantic similarity search for content-based book recommendation.

### 📌 Model Used
- **Model name:** `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- **Architecture:** Transformer-based sentence embedding model
- **Embedding dimension:** 384
- **Use case:** Semantic text similarity and information retrieval

This model was selected due to its strong balance between performance, speed, and memory efficiency, making it suitable for both local development and cloud deployment.

### 🚀 Why Hugging Face?
Hugging Face Hub is used to host and access models because:
- It avoids committing large model files to GitHub
- It enables lightweight cloud deployments (Railway, Docker, etc.)
- Models are automatically cached after first download
- Secure access is supported via access tokens

This approach keeps the repository clean and prevents memory-related build failures.

### 🔐 Authentication & Access
Access to Hugging Face models is handled securely using a **read-only access token**.

#### Creating a Token
1. Create an account at https://huggingface.co
2. Go to **Settings → Access Tokens**
3. Generate a token with **Read** permission

#### Storing the Token
Set the token as an environment variable:

```bash
export HF_TOKEN=your_token_here   # Linux / macOS
setx HF_TOKEN "your_token_here"   # Windows
```

### ⚙️ Model Loading Behavior

At runtime:

- The model is downloaded from Hugging Face Hub
- Cached locally inside the environment
- Reused across subsequent runs

This ensures fast startup after the initial download and efficient memory usage.

### ☁️ Cloud Deployment Considerations

For cloud platforms (e.g., Railway, Docker-based services):

- Model files are not included in the repository
- The Hugging Face token is provided via environment variables
- Model download occurs during application startup

This design avoids large build artifacts and reduces deployment failures caused by memory limits.

### ❓ Why Hugging Face?
*   **Railway Limits**: Free/Trial tiers often have < 4GB disk space and limited RAM. Storing 500MB+ of model data in the Docker image causes slow boots and potential "Out of Disk" errors.
*   **GitHub Limits**: GitHub LFS is limited/paid for large files. Standard git repos should be kept under 100MB for optimal performance.
*   **Accessibility**: Hugging Face acts as a "Model CDN", serving assets with high availability.
